of multiplications of force On any portion of a confined liquid if force is applied by a smaller piston, then forces of greater magnitudes are exerted on the pistons of greater cross sectional area. This is known as principle of multiplication of force. Let, C1 and C2 be two cylinders (Fig:5.10) and A1 and A2 be their cross sectional areas respectively. The two cylinders are connected by a pipe. There is an air tight piston in each cylinder. The two cylinders are filled up with a liquid. Now a force F applied to the smaller piston generates a pressure F1/A1. According to Pascal’s law this pressure is transmitted in all directions through the liquid. Therefore the upward pressure exerted on the larger piston is F1/A1. Because of this pressure, the larger piston experiences an upward force equal to (F1/A1) × A2. If the upward force of larger piston is F2, then F2

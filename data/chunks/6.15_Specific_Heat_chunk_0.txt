The amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a body of mass 1Kg through 1K is called the specific heat of the material of that body. It is denoted by the letter S. Mathematically we can express, Specific heat, S =        =        x            =                … … (6.7) Unit: The unit of specific heat is Jkg-1K-1. The specific heat of lead is 130Jkg-1K-1 means 130J heat is required to raise the temperature of 1kg of lead through 1K.

stopwatch. 5. When the runner will just cross the rope the respective person will stop his stopwatch. You will find the amount of time from the stopwatch. 6. Find average speed by dividing the distance by time for that time interval. 7. Draw a graph by plotting time (t) along X-axis and distance (d) along Y-axis. 8. Determine the distance traveled at any time, average speed of that time interval and instantaneous speed of that moment from the graph. 9. Draw the graph again and find the instantaneous speed of two separate time and find the average acceleration by dividing the difference of speed. 10.  Repeat this experiment walking and running at different speed. 11.  Every student will do the experiment in the same way. Table Reading Traveled distance (m) Time (s) Average speed = distance / time 1

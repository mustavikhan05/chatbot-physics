frictional force of the engine. The amount of energy obtained from the engine is called effective energy. In this case the equation of energy is, Given energy = Effective energy + the energy lost in other ways The efficiency of an engine means that how much of the given energy is obtained as effective energy. So, the efficiency means the ratio of effective energy and the total given energy. Usually the efficiency is expressed in percentage. ∴ efficiency, η = × 100% Energy transformation takes place in different steps in a normal electricity production centre. This transformation continues from coal, oil, natural gas or Uranium up to the production of electricity. It is seen that up to 70% of this energy is lost as heat energy. At last only the 30% of input energy is transformed into useable electrical energy. So, we can say the efficiency of the electricity production centre is 30%. Mathematical Example 4.5: An electric motor is used to lift a body of weight 10N at a height 5m. It uses electrical energy of 65J. a) What is the energy lost by the motor? b) Find the efficiency of the motor. Ans: a) Here, energy used = work done  = Force x displacement  = Weight x height  = 10N x 5m  = 50J ∴ The energy lost = Energy supplied – energy used = 65J – 50J = 15J b) Efficiency, η = x 100%  = x 100%

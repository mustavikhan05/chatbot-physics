by using Addison effect. This tube works as a rectifier that means it changes alternating current to direct current. This is the real beginning of electronics. During this time, detector was very necessary for Marconiâ€™s Radio. This tube fills up the need of the detector. As there were two electrodes in it, this is called diode. After two years, an American named Lee de Forest invented another vacuum tube called triode. Since it had three electrodes, it was named as triode. Besides anode and cathode, there was another electrode known as grid in it. Grid controls the flow of electric current from anode to cathode. It is wonderful that the triode can work as an amplifier. So triode plays a vital role in the development of communication.

Mathematics is said to be the language of physics. We usually express the laws of physics in the form of mathematical equation and physicists solved many problems by applying these laws or equations. Various symbols and notations are used according to the SI system for different quantities and units. This SI system of units is not only used in physics but also used in other branches of science now a days for measurement. The following methods are followed for expressing symbol of units of different quantities. 1. The symbol of units are to be expressed by writing a number and a space after it (actually expresses multiplication) for expressing the value of a quality. For example “2.21 Kg’’, “7.3 x 102 m2’’, “22 k’’. The sign of % also follows the same rule. However Physics  13 space after number is not used to express the unit of angle i.e. degree, minute, and second ( ° , ` and " ). 2. Derived unit produced by multiplication is expressed using a space between two units e.g. N m. 3. Derived unit produced by division is expressed as negative power e.g. meter/second is expressed as ms-1

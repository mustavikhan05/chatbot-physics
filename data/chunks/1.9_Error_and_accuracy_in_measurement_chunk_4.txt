substance For taking the reading of any length by slide calipers. Length = Main scale reading (M) + Vernier super imposition (V) x vernier constant (VC) that is, L or B or H = M + V x VC Apparatus : Slide calipers, Rectangular substance Procedure : 1) The value of the smallest division of the main scale of the slide calipers and the total number of divisions of the vernier scale are observed and from that the vernier constant (VC) of the instrument is determined. 2)  The length of the rectangular substance be measured with the help of the slide calipers by placing the two surface of the body between the two jaws of the calipers. Physics  21 In this position where the zero mark of the vernier scale crosses the mark of the main scale, that mark is the reading of the main scale, M. 3)  In this position which particular mark of the vernier scale coincides with mark of the main scale should be found out. This is vernier super-imposition V. 4)  The length of the body may take at least thrice in different positions by repeating the process 2 and 3 and then these regarding are written in a table. 5)  The breath of the body may take with the slide calipers placing the substance between the jaws of the calipers, the process 2 and 3 should repeat and then results place in the table. 6)  Similarly the height of the rectangular body will place in the same way by repeating the process 2 and 3, at least three reading should take and results note in the table. 7)  By measuring the length, breath and height of the rectangular body, the volume may determine with the help of the equation i and ii.

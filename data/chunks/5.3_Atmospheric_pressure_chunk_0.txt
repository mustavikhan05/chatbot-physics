This earth is surrounded by air.  Atmosphere has weight. So it has pressure. This very pressure on earth surface is almost 105N per square meter. The atmospheric pressure is 1.5x105N on the body of an adult if the area of his body is 1.5m2. As the internal blood pressure of a human body is greater to some extent than the atmospheric pressure, generally it is not felt by the people. The atmosphere for its weight applies force on the earth’s surface and the amount of force acting perpendicularly on per-unit surface area of the earth, is called atmospheric pressure. 2000kg 2m3 Figur: 5.2 Physics  91 Torricelli’s experiment and the measure of atmospheric pressure Take a glass tube about one meter long opened at one end having uniform diameter. Fill the whole tube with pure mercury. Close the open end of the tube tightly with finger and invert the tube. Take this inverted end of the tube along with your finger inside the pure mercury contained in a container. Now remove the finger and take necessary steps to keep the tube vertical. It will be observed that the mercury has come down to some extent and has attained a steady position. It might appear apparently that the mercury inside the tube is in standing position by itself. But in reality it is not so. It happens so due to air pressure. Atmosphere is always exerting pressure on the mercury of the container.

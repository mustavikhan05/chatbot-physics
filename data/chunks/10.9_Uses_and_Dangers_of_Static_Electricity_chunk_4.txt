us. When we change our clothes, there is a possibility of getting light shock as the charges pass to the ground through our body. Operation Theater: Necessary measures have to be taken to keep the surgeons, concerned people and treatment equipments of the operation theater in a hospital free from electric charges as they attract dirt and germs. This is why they have to wear conductor shoes of rubber and use rubber gloves. So that electron can pass through them to the ground. Hanging metal chain with petrol transporting truck: A metal chain has to be hung touching the road with the trucks that carries petrol, diesel or other liquid fuels. When a truck moves along the road, the petrol in the tank dashes against the inner surface of the tank and oscillates to and fro. As a result of this, friction charge is stored in petrol. If any spark takes place from the edge of the tank it may cause serious accident and may set fire. So the charges in petrol are not safe. Therefore a chain is connected at the back of the tank so that the charge can pass through it to the ground easily as metal is a good conductor. No direct connection between metal pillar and electric line: The metal pillars on the road have no direct connection with electric lines pulled over the pillars. As metals are good conductors, the electricity of the wire may pass through the pillar to the ground if the pillar has connection with wires. If anyone touches the pillar he could immediately be electrified causing serious accident. So the wires are connected to the pillars by a porcelain cup. Thunder bolt and lightning conductors: We know that there is water vapor in atmosphere. This water vapor being condensed on the charged ions on the atmosphere and form water 172

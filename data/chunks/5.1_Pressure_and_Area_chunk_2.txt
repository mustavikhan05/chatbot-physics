area, we get the unit of pressure. Therefore the unit of pressure is Nm-2. It is called pascal (Pa). ∴ 1Pa = 1Nm-2 If a force of 1N force is applied perpendicularly to an area of 1m2, then the pressure generated is known as 1Pa. Mathematical Example 5.1: The mass of a woman wearing a shoe is 50kg. The area of the bottom of the shoe is 200cm2. Find the pressure. We know. Pressure P = F/A = W/A = = 2.45×104Pa Given, mass,  m=50kg force, F = w = mg = 50kg×9.8ms-2 = 490N Area of the bottom of the shoe, A = 200cm2 = 200×10-4m2 5.2: Density The space occupied by a body is called its volume. If we drop a piece of cork and a piece of iron of the same volume into water, we see that the piece of cork floats on water but the piece of iron gets submerged into water. We may say in general that the density of iron is more than the density of cork. So, iron gets sunk into water. Though the volume of the substances are the same, actually the more the density, the heavier the object is, and the less the density, the lighter the object is. The mass per unit volume of a substance is called the density of its material. Density is a general property of matter. Density of a body depends on its material and temperature. Density is denoted by ρ. If the mass of a body is m and its volume is V, then density ρ = m V  =  mass of the body volume of the body The unit of density is kgm-3. Task: Take two jugs of equal volume. Fill up one jug with water and the other with honey. Lift both the jugs by your hands. Which one is felt heavier? The jug filled with honey will appear heavier because the density of honey is more. 200×10 -4 m 2 490N 90

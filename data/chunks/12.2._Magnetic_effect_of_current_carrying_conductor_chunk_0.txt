Experiment: Make an electric circuit by putting a conducting wire into hard paper. Keep the paper horizontal and spread some dust of iron on the paper. Now connect the current through circuit or conductor and strike slowly with your finger on hard paper. It is seen that the dust of the iron will get them arranged like the figure 12.2.If you draw a dot using a small compass and added to it, you will find the same. If you change the direction of the current, the needle of the compass will direct the opposite side which will remain facing to the opposite direction. So the flow of electricity produced magnetic field around the conductor also.

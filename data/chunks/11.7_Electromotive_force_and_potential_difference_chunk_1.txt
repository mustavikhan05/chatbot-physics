work done by the source or the energy spent by the source in driving a unit positive charge from one point of the circuit to the same point by traversing the complete circuit along with the source. If the work done is W J in bringing Q C of charge in a complete circuit, then the work done in bringing 1 C of charge is W Q . Therefore the electromotive force of the source is, W E Q = Unit: The SI unit of electromotive force is JC-1 or volt (V). The devices which can transform some other forms of energy into electrical energy they only have electromotive force. For example: cell, generator, etc. An electric cell converts chemical energy into electrical energy and a generator coverts mechanical energy into electrical energy. The electromotive force of a cell is the sum of the potential differences which develops in different parts of the circuit along with the cell. Potential difference: The electricity flows through a conductor due to the potential difference between the two terminals. The potential difference between any two points is defined as the amount of work done to carry unit positive charge from one point to another of a circuit. When a dry cell is used in a torch, the electrical energy provided by the dry cell is converted into light and heat energy. The conservation of energy is maintained in this process of transformation of energy. The amount of energy converted across the light bulb for migration of unit positive charge is the potential difference between the two terminals of the bulb. Therefore, the potential difference between the two points of a circuit is defined as the amount of electrical energy converted to other forms of energy (e.g. - heat, light) when unit positive charge migrates between the two points. If W is the amount of electrical energy converted to other forms for migration of Q amount of charge, then the potential difference between the two points is Fig. 11.6 182  Physics W V Q =

errors should be zero if the value of the quantity is measured by the same instrument. The random error will be included as much as many time the scale is used to measure the floor. Each time the front edge marking on the floor falls a little back and forth of the accurate mark. Another random error takes place with the measurement when the meter scale is placed at the previous marking (slightly error position) as back edge starts from back and forth position. The final result may be very much high or low due to random error. It is impossible to avoid random error but this error can be reduced by precautionary measurement. In order to minimize the random error average of the frequent measurement is to be taken. b) Instrumental error : We need instruments for experimental measurement in physics. The error with the instrument is called instrumental error. For example, if the zero marking of main scale is not super-imposition with the zero marking vernier then the result of measurement will not be accurate. This kind of error is known as instrumental 20

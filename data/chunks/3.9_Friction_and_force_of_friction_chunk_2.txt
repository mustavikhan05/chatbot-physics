onto one another. As a result of which the motion of one surface over another surface gets obstacled. As the grooves of a surface deepend and their number increases i.e. as the surface become rougher, the motion of one surface over another becomes more obstructed. Then the magnitude of frictional force also increases. The body becomes mobile if it can overcome the resistance of the surface in contact. The frictional force causes the object to slow down and stop thereby. Figure: 3.8 Types of friction Generally there are four types of friction. 1. Static friction 2. Sliding friction 3. Rolling friction 4. Fluid friction Static friction Static friction is the friction between two surfaces that aren't moving relatively to each other. When a force is applied to an object, but it does not cause it to move, then static friction works. When a massive body on a floor is pulled by a force but it does not move, then the frictional force created is called force of static friction. The static frictional force is developed opposite to the applied force and acts until motion is produced. When two bodies at rest are in contact with one another and one body is made to move on the other body, the friction produced between them until a relative motion is created is called static friction. 62  Physics Sliding friction Sliding friction is friction where an object slides, or rubs against, another surface. We fall down and traverse a small distance when we move in a slippery road. When a hard brake is applied on a car moving fast, the car does not stop rather cross a small distance by sliding. Rolling friction Rolling friction is friction between a rolling object and the surface that it is rolling on. The wheelâ€™s motion of a cycle, motion of marble is example of rolling friction.

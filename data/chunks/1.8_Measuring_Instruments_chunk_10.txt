a substance needs to be measured very accurately, this is not possible with a common balance. The less quantity of the substance, the more accurate the balance should be. The balance is such an accurate weighting machine. This instrument is used in physics and chemistry laboratories for accurate measurement of small masses. Because, if the measurement of the mass in the laboratory is not accurate, the result will be wrong and the objective of the experiment will not be fulfilled. Fig 1.4 then the diameter of the wire = 3mm + 20 x 0.01mm = 3mm + 0.2mm = 3.2mm 18  Physics

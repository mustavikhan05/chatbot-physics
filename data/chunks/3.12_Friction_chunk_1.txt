cannot move easily. Any device that has moving parts can wear out and tear due to friction. In any type of vehicles- may be car, boat or airplane, extra fuel has to be spent to overcome the excess friction. Fuel energy is being wasted because of friction. The energy that is wasted for friction mainly appears as heat energy. Not only that energy is converted to heat due to friction, but also the parts of an engine may be overheated. As a result of friction, the soles of your shoes wear and tear out. So to make the life and works easier we need friction but excess friction is the cause of many losses too. Therefore to produce the necessary friction, we have to control it. Sometimes we need to increase or decrease friction by some processes. Therefore, we cannot discard friction totally; also friction is beneficial to us in many cases. For this reason friction is called a necessary evil. Preparing report Present a report to your teacher about the positive impact of friction in our life in the light of section 3.9 to 3.12. Teacher will select the best report and tell the student to present in the class room. Investigation 3.1: Measurement of force acting on a body Objective: To measure force by simple experiment Formula: We know, if a force F acts on a body of mass m and the resulting acceleration due to the force is a, then F=ma. The acceleration a  of the body can be expressed by g  in case of force due to gravity. That is, the force of gravity or weight of the body, W mg = . We shall measure weight of a body as an example of force. 66

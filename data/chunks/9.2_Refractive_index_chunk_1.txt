angle of refraction is r, then sin i sin r will be a constant and it is called refractive index of the second medium with respect to the first medium for that colour of light. It is expressed by n. Fig:9.3 glass slab Physics 145 Fig:9.5 Fig:9.6 If the ray of light enters in the medium b from medium a then the refractive index of medium b with respect to a is (fig 9.5), anb = sin i sin r (9.1) The right subscript of n indicates the medium of which refractive index is and the left subscript of n indicates the medium with respect to which the refractive index is. Again when the ray of light enters obliquely to a medium from vacuum, then the refractive index of the medium with respect to vacuum is called absolute refractive index of the medium for that particular colour of light (fig:9.6). If the ray of light refracts into medium b from vacuum, then the absolute refractive index of medium b is nb = sin i sin r . During expressing absolute refractive index of given medium nothing on left side of n is used as subscript and on right side of n the medium is written as subscript. For example, absolute refractive index of medium b is nb. When light passes from medium b to the medium a then according to the reversibility of ray of light (fig 9.5) CB will be the incident ray and BA will be the refracted ray, i.e. here the angle of incidence = r and the angle of refraction = i. Therefore the refractive index of medium a with respect to b will be [according to equation 9.1] bna = sin r sin i  = 1 sin i / sin r =  1 anb

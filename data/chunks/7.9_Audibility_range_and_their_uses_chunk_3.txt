123 change. This type of sound is produced during earth quakes and nuclear explosions and destroys many things with great shake. Mathematical example 7.3 A man clapped standing on one of the banks of a river. Echo is heard after 1.5s due to the reflection of the sound from another bank. If the velocity of sound at that time is 340ms-1, what is the breadth of the river? Solution: Suppose the breadth of river d. We know, 2d= v.t So, d = vt 2 =  340ms-1Ã—1.5 s 2  =255m so, the width of river is 255m.

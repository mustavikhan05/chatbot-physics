The complete path through which electric current can flow is called electric circuit. When two plates of a cell are joined to the two ends of a resistor or an electric devices an electric circuit is formed. We have to draw simple and clear circuit diagrams to study current electricity.  Symbols that are used to represent common electrical devices that are employed to draw electric circuits are shown in table. 178  Physics Table 11.1: Symbols of circuit                     Do yourself: Using a switch, electric cell, fixed resistor and ammeter draw a series circuit. Now, connect a voltmeter in parallel with two terminals of a fixed resistor.

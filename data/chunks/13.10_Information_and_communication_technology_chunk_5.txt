cellular and mobile-phone has been made. How does telephone work In every telephone set, there is a system of receiving and transmitting signal. The mouthpiece of a telephone is microphone, it is the transmitter and the ear-piece is a speaker, and is the receiver. There is a ringer for making the ringing sound and a dialing system in a telephone set. When we speak, the microphone of the mouthpiece converts our voice into electrical signal. This signal reaches to the ear-piece of another telephone through the telephone wire. The speaker of the earpiece converts the electrical signal into sound. As a result, the caller or the called person can hear the sound and answer. This answer of the called person returns to the telephone set of the caller after being converted into electrical signal with the help of microphone of the mouthpiece and it is transformed into sound in the speaker of the earpiece of the caller, then the caller hears the speech of the called person. The electrical signal travels so fast through the telephone wire that it does not delay any single moment to transfer.

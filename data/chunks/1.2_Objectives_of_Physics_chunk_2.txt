our life. We cannot change the function and laws of nature but can utilize them. For their proper utilization we need sufficient knowledge about them. Moreover physics is the science that studies on this earth for innovation. Development of technology results from the proper application of fundamental laws of physics : We have to have knowledge about the fundamental laws of physics if want to know how television works, rocket flies in the space, artificial satellite revolves around the earth, , mobile phone functions, submarine remain submerged into water and how by using internet the whole world can be explored in a moment . The discovered laws of physics pave the way to invent these technologies. Study of physics is a perfect human training

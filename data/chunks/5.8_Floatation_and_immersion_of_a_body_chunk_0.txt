Two forces act simultaneously on a body when it is released in a liquid at rest. 1.  The weight of the body, W1 acts vertically downwards. 2.  The buoyancy W2 acts vertically upward on an immersed body. There are three conditions of floatation and immersion of a body- a)  If W1> W2, i.e. when the weight of the body is greater than the buoyancy of the liquid the body sinks. In this case the weight of the body is more than the weight of the displaced liquid. b)  If W1=W2 i.e. when the weight of the body equals to the buoyancy of the liquid the body floats being fully immersed in liquid. In such situation the weight of the body is equal to the weight of the liquid displaced. c)

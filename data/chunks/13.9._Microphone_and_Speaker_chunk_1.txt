sound wave. There is a moving coil and a thin metallic sheet named diaphragm in the microphone. When a person speaks through a microphone, the diaphragm vibrates by the sound wave. Diaphragm is that part of the microphone which is designed to transform the vibration of sound into electricity. The vibration of different types of sounds vibrates the diaphragm differently. This vibration makes the diaphragm move to and fro in the magnetic field. As a result, Fig: 13.6 Microphone 216 Physics alternating electric current is induced in the moving coil. Thus microphone converts the sound energy into electrical energy. This is called audio signal. Having amplified, this electric audio signal can be transferred to a long distance through a telephone line or radio. So microphone plays a vital role in television and radio broadcasting, recording and telephone. Speaker: Speaker does just the opposite task of the microphone. Speaker converts the electric signal of microphone into corresponding sound wave. Functions of speaker: Most of the loudspeakers are moving coil loudspeaker. It has- 1. A cylindrical permanent magnet which produces a strong magnetic field. 2. A small coil or wire-loop is suspended. This wire-loop can oscillate to and fro in the magnetic field. 3. A paper cone remains attached with wire-loop. When the alternating current produced by the sound flows through the loop, the loop moves to and fro. For this reason, the paper cone is vibrated. As a result, sound is produced.

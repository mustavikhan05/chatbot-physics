such a way that it appears that the ray is coming from principal focus F. Another ray PO from P passes through the optical centre O` and refracts straight along PON. These two refracted rays are divergent so they do not meet. If they are extended in the backward direction then it appears that they are coming from the point P1. Now if we draw a perpendicular P1Q1 on the principal axis from P1 then P1Q1 will be M 152 Physics the virtual image of PQ. This image is virtual, erect and smaller than the object in size. Concave lens always forms image which is virtual, erect and smaller in size than the object. Identification of lens: When we hold a finger in front and very near of a lens and then look from the other side if a virtual, erect and magnified image of the finger is found to be formed, the lens is a convex one. But if the image is virtual, erect and diminished, the lens is a concave one. Do it yourself: Hold a convex lens close to your book. Do the writings seem larger? Why? After being refracted by convex lens, magnified image is formed and so you are seeing the writings larger.

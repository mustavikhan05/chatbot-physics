goes faster ? Ovi or Mitu, definitely Mitu goes faster because she takes less time. Suppose, Ovi travels 100m in 50 seconds, Mitu travels 75m in 30 seconds can we say Ovi goes slower than Mitu ? Does not Ovi travel more distance than Mitu ? The distance of a particular time Ovi and Mitu travels has to be compared to know who goes faster. Let the particular time be 1 second therefore, In 1 second Ovi travels 100 50 = 2 meter In 1 second Mitu travels 75 30 = 2.5 meter So, Mitu goes faster than Ovi because in 1 second Mitu travels more distance than Ovi. From the above discussion we can understand time and distance determines who goes faster. The quantity by which we can measure how fast a body moves or distance traveled, is called speed. Speed expresses the rate of change position of a body. The rate of change of position of a body with time is called the speed. Speed of a body is measured by the distance traveled per unit time. i.e Speed = distance time If a moving body travels a distance `d’ in time `t’ then the speed v is

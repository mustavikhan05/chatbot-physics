to change the state of a body something external must be applied. That is, the external cause which changes or tends to change the state of an object is called force. Thus from Newton’s first law we get qualitative definition of force. According to Newton’s first law, a force is that which acting on a body at rest produces or tends to produce motion or acting on a moving body changes or tends to change its state of motion.

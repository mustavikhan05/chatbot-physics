Look at figure 9.1. here two media, air and glass are shown. Coming from air medium following the path AB, light ray incidents at point B of the separation surface PQ of two media. If the light ray goes straight it will follow the path BCâ€² but it changes its path and follows BC. This phenomenon of bending of ray of light is called refraction. Therefore, when the ray of light travels obliquely from one transparent medium to another, the bending of ray of light at the surface of separation of the two media is called the refraction of light.

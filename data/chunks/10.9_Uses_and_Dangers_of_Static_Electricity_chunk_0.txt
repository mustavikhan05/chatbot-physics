1. Electrostatic Painting Spray: Nowadays painting spray is used to colour car, cycle, cupboard or other things with help of static electricity. Spray gun is made in such a way that it produces very small charged particles of colour. The sharp edge of the painting spray gun is connected to a terminal of the static electrical generator. The other terminal of the generator is connected to the metal plate to be coloured which must be connected with earth. In case of colouring a car the charged small particle emitted from the spray gun attracts the outer frame of the car. As a result a uniform layer of colour is formed on the outer surface of the car. Moreover these small particles move along the electric lines of force and reach the narrower places of its surface and colour it. 2. Ink Jet Printer: This is the most ordinary printer which remains connected to the computer. An ink-gun with its narrow mouth projects very small particles of ink. These small particles are positively charged. These ink particles move through the space between two plates. These positively charged ink particles are repelled by the positive plate and attracted by the negative plate. A computer controls the voltage of the plates in such a way that the plates are sometimes positively charged and sometimes negatively charged. And the ink particles fall on moving paper scattered in different places to give the necessary shape of letters and pictures. For colour print four kinds of colour are used. 3. Photocopier: Nowadays photocopier or photocopy machine is very essential and thus it has become very popular machine. Not only the educational institutions and other offices but also general people use this machine to photocopy any kind of necessary papers and documents. Static energy is also used in this machine. There is a rotating dram inside the dark part of the photocopier.

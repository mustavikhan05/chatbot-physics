= displacement 1 time time = displacement time2 Therefore, [ a ] = L  = LT-2   T2   Unit : The unit of acceleration is the unit of velocity / time , that is, ms-1 / s = ms-2 The acceleration of a body is 5ms-2 towards south means that the velocity of the body increases by 5ms-1 in 1 second towards south. Uniform acceleration and non-uniform acceleration : Acceleration may be two types. Such as- uniform acceleration and non-uniform acceleration. If the rate of increase of velocity of a moving body in a particular direction is maintained constant all the time, then the acceleration is said to be uniform. Conversely, if the rate of increase of velocity changes with time, the acceleration is said to be non-uniform or variable. An example of uniform acceleration is the acceleration of a freely falling, body due to gravity the acceleration of a freely falling body is 9.8ms-2, that is, its velocity increases by 9.8ms-1 for each successive seconds. That is, generally we see these moving body- car, cycle, rickshaw, etc are the example of non-uniform acceleration. Mathematical Example 2.1 : Velocity of a car increases uniformly at the rate of 5ms-1 and after 10s becomes 45ms-1 . Find the acceleration of the car. Solution : Here,  We know, initial velocity u = 5ms-1  a = v – u    final velocity  v  = 45ms-1 t    time t  = 5s  or, a =  45ms-1 – 5ms-1  ∴acceleration a  = ? 5s

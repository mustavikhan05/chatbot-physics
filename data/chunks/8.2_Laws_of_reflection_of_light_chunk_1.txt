a second medium, then a portion of the light returns back to the first medium from the surface of separation of two medium. This phenomenon is called reflection of light. Laws of reflection: The incident and reflected ray obey two simple laws: 1. First law: The incident ray, reflected ray and the normal at the point of incidence on the reflector lie in the same plane. 2. Second law: The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. Figure 8.2: Reflection of light When light is reflected from a surface, then it must obey the laws of reflection. How light will be reflected from a surface depends upon the nature of the reflecting surface. Depending on the nature of the reflecting surface, reflection may be of two kinds. 1. Regular or uniform reflection 2. Diffused or irregular reflection 1. Regular reflection: If a parallel beam of light falls on a smooth surface and after reflection remains parallel, or is converted into a convergent or a divergent beam, then such type of reflection is called regular reflection. For example- when a parallel beam of light incident on a plane mirror or on a well polished metal surface, the beam remains parallel even after reflection. In this case, the angle of incidence for each incident ray is the same and the angle of reflection for each of the ray is also the same due to regular reflection.

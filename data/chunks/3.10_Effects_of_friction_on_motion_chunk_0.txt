Friction has enormous influence on the motion of an object. Friction is a kind of resistive force which slows down the motion of a body. Though friction creates many problems in our daily lives, it plays a vital role for movement and vehicle operaration. In this section we shall discuss about tyre’s surface, smoothness of road and role of friction for controlling motion. Tyre’s surface Driving vehicles is possible because of the friction between the tyres and the road surface. The friction force between the tyres and the road depends on condition of the tyres and surface of the road. It also depends on the weight of the vehicle. The tyre’s rubber surface is designed with treads i.e. grooves or teeth. The tyre surface is up and down due to these grooves. If the tyre is new, these grooves are distinct; as a result the force of friction between the tyre and the road is maximum. When the tyre becomes old, Figure: 3.9 Physics

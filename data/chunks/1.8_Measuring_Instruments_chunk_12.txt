beam is made horizontal with the help of a plumb-line (PL) and the leveling screws. The entire instrument is kept in a glass box. Measurement by Balance : To use the balance, the handle H is rotated to left the pillar and hence the beam AB .The beam will then start swing freely about the knife edge. Along with the beam the scale pans will also keep in swinging up and down, with the backward rotation of the handle H. The pillar will be lowered and the swinging of the beam and scale pans will stop. When the beam AB swings, the lower end of the pointer keeps oscillating right and left over the scale. If there is nothing on the scale pan, the oscillation of the pointer should be equal on the two sides of the zero of the scale. If it is not, the two adjusted screws (BS) at the two ends of the beam AB are to be so adjusted that the oscillation of the pointer on the two sides of the zero of the scale becomes equal. Whether the pillar P is vertical or not is seen with the plumb-line PL. To measure the mass of an object it is placed on the left-hand pan. Known weights are placed slowly on the right-hand pan one by one, till the pointer oscillates equally to the two sides of the zero of the scale. Thus the mass of an object is determined with the help of known weights. Stopwatch Stopwatch is used to measure small time interval. Stopwatches are of two kinds digital stopwatch and analog stopwatch. Digital stopwatch can give more accurate reading than that of analog stopwatch. A analog stopwatch can give an accurate reading up to ± 0.15 while a digital stopwatch can read accurately up to ±0.015. Now a days digital stopwatch is found in mobile phone also. Physics

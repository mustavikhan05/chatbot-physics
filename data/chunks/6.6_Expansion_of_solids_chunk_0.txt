With the application of heat the length, area and volume of solid substance expands. Linear expansion of solid and coefficient of linear expansion: When heat is applied to a solid substance elongation of its length occurs towards a definite direction and the expansion along its length is called linear expansion. Let the length of a bar at  θ1 temperature be l1 and at θ2 temperature the length be l2. Increase in length = l2 – l1 And increase of temperature = θ2 -  θ1 The coefficient of linear expansion is denoted by α and it can be expressed as, α = … … … (6.2)   = In equation 6.2, if the initial length l1 = 1m and increase of temperature, θ2 - θ1 = 1K, then α = l2 – l1 = increase in length. l2 - l1 l1(θ2 - θ1) Increase in length Initial length x increase of temperature Fig: 6.4 Physics  105 So, the increase in length of a solid rod of 1m for a rise of temperature 1K is defined as the coefficient of linear expansion of the material of the solid. Its unit is K-1. The coefficient of linear expansion of copper is 16.7 × 10-6 K-1 means if the temperature of copper rod is raised through 1K, then its length increases by 16.7 × 10-6 m. Mathematical example 6.2: The length of a steel rod is 100m at 20°C. If its length becomes 100.033m at 50°C, then determine the coefficient of linear expansion of steel. We know, Coefficient of linear expansion, α =    =

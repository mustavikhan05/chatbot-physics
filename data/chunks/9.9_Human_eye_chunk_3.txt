of the object on the screen at its previous position, we have to use lenses of different focal lengths. Things happen in a similar way in case of eyes. The cornea, aqueous humour, eye lens and vitreous humour together work as a convergent lens system. If any object is placed before our eyes and if the image of that object is reflected on our retina, then there will be a sensation of vision in the brain. As a result, we see the object. We see objects of different distances through our eyes. The specialty of the eye lens is that it changes its shape according to the necessity and thus it changes its focal length. Due to the change of the focal length, image of objects at any position is always formed at the same distance from the lens. Therefore, clear images are formed on the retina. The capacity of eyes to change their focal length to see objects of any distance is called the accommodation power of eyes. And the process is called accommodation of eye. Least distance of distinct vision: From our daily experience, we see that the closer the object is to the eyes the clearer it is to see. But, there is a point after which it cannot be seen clearly. The nearest point at which eyes can see without any difficulty is called the distance of distinct vision. For any normal eye, this distance is nearly 25cm. So, the near point of a normal eye is 25 cm away from the eye. It is difficult for our eyes to see any object clearly that stays closer to this distance. Again, the distance which is maximum from the eye to see an object is called the farthest distance of distinct vision. It is also called the far point of the eye. The far point of any normal eye is at infinity. This means that a normal eye can see up to a huge distance. Physics

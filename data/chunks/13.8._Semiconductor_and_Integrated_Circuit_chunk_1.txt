saves radio, TV, computer etc. to be electrified due to faulty connection. It is necessary to amplify the electric current and voltage for various reasons. The instrument which performs this work is called an amplifier. Transistor is such a device which works as an amplifier and high speed switch. A transistor is made when a p-type substance is introduced between two n-type materials like a sandwich. These three layers are called collector, base and emitter. The two n-type regions are the emitter and collector and the narrow p-type region is the base of the Figure 13.4: Diode and its symbol Fig: 13.5: Transistor and its symbol Physics

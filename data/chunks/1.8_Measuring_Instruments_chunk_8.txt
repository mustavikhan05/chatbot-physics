the Pitch of the screw gauge. The distance through which the screw advances when the circular scale is rotated through only 1 division is called the least count. The least count is obtained by dividing the pitch by the number of divisions in the circular scale. vernier mark has coincide with a main scale mark. Then the length of the rod will be L = 12mm + 7 x 0.1mm (here vernier constant is 0.1mm) = 12.7mm = 1.27cm. Physics 17 Therefore, Least count = Pitch no. of division of the circular scale. Usually the circular scale has 100 divisions and the pitch is 1mm. Least count = 1 100mm = 0.01mm. Measurement by Screw Gauge : The wire whose diameter is to be measured or the plate whose thickness is to be determined is placed between A and B. The wire or the plate should be so placed that itâ€™s one side touches A and the other side touches B. Now the reading of the linear and circular scales is to be taken. Suppose the reading of the linear scale 1mm, and the number of divisions of the circular scale is C. Then the diameter of the wire or the thickness of the plate will be : Diameter or thickness = Linear scale reading + no. of divisions of the circular scale x Least count. That is, D = L + C x LC

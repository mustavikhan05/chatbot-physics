along the direction of force. Therefore, Work = Force × Distance travelled along the direction of force If a force F is applied on a body and the body travels a distance s along the direction of force (fig: 4.1) then the work done (W) will be, W= Fs… … … (4.1) Work has no direction. It is a scalar quantity. Dimension of Work: Dimension of work will be the dimension of force × dimension of displacement Figure: 4.1 70 Physics or, Work = Force × displacement  = mass × acceleration × displacement = mass × × displacement

and the other side touches B. Now the reading of the linear and circular scales is to be taken. Suppose the reading of the linear scale 1mm, and the number of divisions of the circular scale is C. Then the diameter of the wire or the thickness of the plate will be : Diameter or thickness = Linear scale reading + no. of divisions of the circular scale x Least count. That is, D = L + C x LC When the head of the screw touches the plane end of the fixed rod A, then the zero of the circular scale should coincide with the zero of the linear scale, then it means there is an error. For this reading should be corrected. Balance : Sometimes in physics and chemistry the mass of a small quantity of a substance needs to be measured very accurately, this is not possible with a common balance. The less quantity of the substance, the more accurate the balance should be. The balance is such an accurate weighting machine. This instrument is used in physics and chemistry laboratories for accurate measurement of small masses. Because, if the measurement of the mass in the laboratory is not accurate, the result will be wrong and the objective of the experiment will not be fulfilled.

and Lenz (1804-1865 A.D) towards discovering the fact that magnetic effect produces electric current. In fact, this was a discovery of the process of converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. In 1864 James Clark Maxwell (1831-1879 A.D) demonstrated that light is one kind of electromagnetic wave. He established the electromagnetic theory by combining electric and magnetic field. Similar kind of radiation was also discovered and produced in 1888 by Heinrich Hertz (1857-1894 A.D). Using the same kind of waves in 1896, Marconi (1874-1937 A.D) discovered the method of sending signal through ″Morse code″ to far off distance. Before him Sir Jagadish Chandra Basu (1858-1937 A.D) was able to send energy from one place to another through electromagnetic wave. In this way radio communication was developed. By the end of nineteenth century Roentgen (1845-1923 A.D) discovered x-rays and Becquerel (1852-1908 A.D) discovered the radio activity of uranium. In the twentieth century surprising advancement took place in the field of physics. Max Planck (1858-1947 A.D) discovered quantum theory of radiation. Albert Einstein (1879- 1955 A.D) invented theory of relativity.

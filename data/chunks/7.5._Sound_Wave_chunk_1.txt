expansion of the substance are created (Fig 7.9).This sound wave makes a sense of hearing in our ear by being circulated from the medium. It is noticeable that the sound is not created without vibration. When tune-pin copper, bowl, the bell of school is ringing, you will understand that they are vibrating if you touch them. When you speak, you will see that your throat is vibrating. Here, Wave-length, λ=20cm=0.2m Sound-velocity=340ms-1 Frequency, ƒ =? Period (time), T=? Figure: 7.9 Physics 119 Activities: Take water in a brass bowl. Strike the bowl. You can hear sound. Small waves are seen on the water. Now hold the bowl by your hand. Can you hear sound now? Is there any wave in water? As long as the bowl produces sound it continues its vibration. So, small waves are produced in water. While the vibration of the bowl stops, the sound stops, so does the wave. So it is understood that a vibrating object can produce sound. But it does not mean that any vibration of any object can produce audible sound. For an audible sound there must have a material medium between the source of sound and the listener, and the frequency will be in between 20Hz to 20000Hz. Characteristics of sound wave: Vibration of an objects produces sound wave and an elastic material medium is needed for its propagation. So, sound is called a mechanical wave. Since the direction of propagation of wave and of particles are in the same direction, so is longitudinal. The velocity of sound wave depends on the nature of the medium. The velocity

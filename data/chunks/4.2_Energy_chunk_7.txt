Physics 73 Potential Energy: If a piece of stone or brick falls on a body from the roof of a building it may flatten or break the body. When the stone or brick was in rest on the roof potential energy was stored in it but the potential energy works when it falls down. The energy was stored in the stone because it was above the ground. What will happen when the two ends of a spring is stretched and tied to two objects and then released? The objects will move fast and collide with each other. The stretched spring was at rest but potential energy was there in it. If it is released it may work. The energy was stored in the stretched spring because it was strained. The ability of a body to do work when its normal position or configuration is changed to some other position or configuration is called potential energy. Expanded Activities: Take a pulley and place a rope on it. Tie a heavy object A with its one end and a light object B with the other end. Such that, A remains above the ground but B remains on the ground [Fig: 4.3]. Remove your hand. What did you see? The object A goes down and object B goes up. The potential energy was stored in the object A as it was above the ground from its normal position and gained ability to work. It can work till it reaches the ground that is it can raise the object B. Experiment: Take a spring and tie its one end with a strong support and a block to its other end. Place them on a smooth surface. Now apply force on the block and contract the spring and keep another object in front of the block [Fig: 4.4] then remove your hand. Why did the object move fast? Spring could work while regaining its original configuration and was able to displace the other body. This ability of spring to work for the change of its normal configuration is its potential energy. If some

be u = 0 Mathematical Example 2.3 : A car starting from rest moves with acceleration of 2ms-2 its velocity reach at 20ms-1 . How long time does the car take part in acceleration activity? Solution : Here, We know, initial velocity u = 0 v = u + at final velocity v = 20ms-1 acceleration a = 2ms-2 or, at = v – u ∴ time = ? t = v – u a = 20ms-1 - 0 2ms-2 10s      Ans : 10s   Mathematical Example 2.4 : A car is moving with a velocity, of 54kmh-1. It is accelerated by 4ms-2 for 5s. What is the final velocity of the car and how far will it travel during the period of acceleration ?  Calculate : Put the value of v of eq (2.1) into equation (2.2) Calculate : Find the value of t from equation (2.1) and put it in eqn (2.2) and by cross multiplication arrange the terms. Physics  39 Solution :  Here,  We know, initial velocity u = 54kms-1  v =  u + at  =  54 km  =  54 x 1000m h 3600s = 3 x 5ms-1 = 15ms-1 + 4ms-2 x 5s  = 15ms-1 = 15ms-1 + 20ms-1   = 35ms-1   Again,      acceleration a = 4ms-2 time, s = 5s final velocity v = ? traveled distance s = ? We know

Physics The length of the rod = main scale reading + vernier scale reading = main scale reading + vernier scale reding x vernier scale constant. Thus, L = M + V x VC, where VC is the vernier constant. The jaw connected with the vernier scale is to be pushed forward so that the jaws of the main scale and the vernier scale touch the opposite ends of the object. In some instrument reading not be coincided. Then have to understand there are some errors in the instruments and have to rectify it. The Screw Gauge This is device for the measurement of radius of wire of this cylinders and small length. It consists of a u-shaped still frame F (1.3).

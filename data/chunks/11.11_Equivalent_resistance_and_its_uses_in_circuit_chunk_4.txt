(11.7) we get, 1 2 3 V V V I R R R = + + 1 2 3 1 1 1 ( ) V R R R = + + (11.8) Now if three resistances R1, R2 and R3 are replaced by a single resistance RP, so that same current I flows through the circuit and the potential difference V across them remains unchanged, then RP is the equivalent resistance of the combination. ∴ P V I R = (11.9) Comparing equations (11.8) I (11.9) we get,  P V R  1 2 3 1 1 1 ( ) V R R R = + +  1 P R 1 2 3 1 1 1 ( ) R R R = + +  If instead of three resistances, n numbers of resistances are connected in parallel then the equivalent resistance RP can be expressed as 1 P R  1 2 3 1 1 1 1 ... n R R R R = + + + + (11.10) That is, resistances connected in parallel combination, the sum of the inverse of the individual resistances is equal to the inverse of the equivalent resistance. Mathematical Example 11.3: If two resistances of values 5 Ω  and10 Ω are connected in series and parallel combination separately, calculate the equivalent resistance in both cases. We know,  1 2 S R R R = +  = 5 Ω  + 10 Ω = 15 Ω Again,  1 2 1 1 1 P R R R = +  1 1 1 5 10 P R = + Ω Ω  Here, First resistance, R1 = 5 Ω Second resistance, R2 = 10 Ω Equivalent resistance in series, RS =? Equivalent resistance in parallel, RP =? Physics  189 = 1 2 1 10 − + Ω  = 1 3 10 − Ω  RP = 3.33 Ω Answer: RS = 15 Ω

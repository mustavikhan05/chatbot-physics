equation (2.1) and put it in eqn (2.2) and by cross multiplication arrange the terms. Physics 39 Solution : Here, We know, initial velocity u = 54kms-1 v = u + at = 54 km = 54 x 1000m h 3600s = 3 x 5ms-1 = 15ms-1 + 4ms-2 x 5s = 15ms-1 = 15ms-1 + 20ms-1 = 35ms-1 Again, acceleration a = 4ms-2 time, s = 5s final velocity v = ? traveled distance s = ? We know s =  ut + 1  at2    2     =  15ms-1 x 5s  + 1  Ã— 4ms-2 2 (5s)2 = 75m + 50m   = 125m     Ans :  Final velocity v = 35ms-1 Traveled distance s = 125m Mathematical Example 2.5 : A car starting from rest in straight moves with uniform acceleration of 10ms-2. What will be the velocity while crossing a person at a distance 80m ? Solution :   Here, We know   Initial velocity     u = 0 v2 = u2 + 2as  Acceleration

time duration, t =0.1 s   = 200 kg ms-2 s   change of momentum, mv -mu =?  =200 kg ms-1          Ans: change of momentum = 200 kg ms-1  Mathematical Example 3.4: A bullet of mass 10 g was shot from a gun with a velocity of 500 ms-1. If the mass of the gun is 2 kg, find the backward velocity of the gun. Solution: Let the direction of the bullet’s velocity i.e. the forward direction be positive. From the conservation of momentum, We get,        1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 m u m u m v m v + = +  ev m1× 0 ms-1 + m2 kg × 0 ms-1= 10-2  kg × 500 ms-1 + 2 kg × v2 ev -1 2 5kg ms 2kg v = −  = -2.5 ms-1 Here, the velocity of the gun is negative, i.e. the gun will move backward. Ans: backward velocity=2.5 ms-1     Here, mass of the bullet, m1 = 10 g = 10× 10-3 kg = 10-2 kg mass of the gun, m2 = 2 kg initial velocity of the bullet, u1 = 0 ms-1 initial velocity of the gun, u2 = 0 ms-1 final velocity of the bullet, v1 = 500 ms-1 final velocity of the gun, v2 =?      60  Physics

lightning conductor and pointed ends discharges their charge to the air particles around it. The air particles around the sharp points are charged by conduction and are attracted by the opposite charges of cloud and moves towards the cloud is neutralized. As a result the probability of thunder bolt decreases. Electricity always passes following the shortest path through a conductor. The charge produced in the clouds tends to reach the earth through the high standing objects. During storm and rain it is rather good to wet in rain than to stand under an umbrella, any tree, near any conductor, iron bridge or fence of sharp iron wire. Investigation:10.1 Production of the charge in the process of friction and induction. Objectives: Demonstration of charges produced in the process of friction and induction. Apparatus: Pith ball, glass rod, silk cloth, piece of rubber and a conductor rod. Working procedure: 1. Suspend a light pith ball from a stand or a hook by a string. 2. Take a dry glass rod. 3. Cover one end of a glass rod by a piece of rubber and hold it. 4. Rub the other end of the glass rod by a piece of silk cloth properly. 5. Bring the rubbed end of the glass rod near a freely suspended pith ball. 6. The glass rod attracts the pith ball towards it as the glass rod is charged due to friction. 7. The glass rod is charged positively. (You can prove that with the help of an electroscope) 8. Now bring the charged glass rod near to an end of an uncharged conductor. Fig: 10.18 Physics

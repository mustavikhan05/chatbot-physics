during the motion of the body, that is if the body travels equal distance in equal interval of time, then the speed of the body is called uniform speed. And if the body does not travel equal distance in equal interval of time then the speed is called non uniform speed. If a body does not move with uniform speed, then the speed obtained by dividing the total distance traveled by time is called average speed. So, average speed = total distance time  If a car runs 300 km in 6 hours since 7 in the morning on the way from Dhaka to Dinajpur, the average speed of the car is 300km/6h = 50kmh-1. Here, average speed 50kmh-1 does not mean the car travels 50km in every hour rather it might travel sometimes faster or sometimes slower than the average speed. Instantaneous speed : If we want to know the instantaneous speed of any body at any instant, for example what was the speed of the car just the moment its 33miniutes travel is over, the speed of that moment will be the instantaneous speed. To find the instantaneous speed at any instant, the distance traveled at during a small interval, has to be known and then the distance has to be divided by the time interval. If any one wants to the speed of the car at 10 : 32 : 43 am ( 10 hours 32 minute 43 second) or at the time of cross over a speed breaker on the highway beside any school, he has to see the reading of the speedometer at the moment. Similarly with the help of Rudder or Laser gun we can know whether a car is violating the highest limit on the highway or the speed every ball of Mashrafi Bin Murtaja, the fastest bowler of Bangladesh national team. Velocity : Sometimes during usual conversation many people use the word velocity to mean speed. But in science the two words do not mean the same thing speed indicates only the rate of change of position with time, it does not indicate the direction of change 34  Physics

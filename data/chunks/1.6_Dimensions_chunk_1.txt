dimensions in any quantity. As for Except these above mentioned three physical quantities of length, mass and time others dimension of physical quantities are : The dimension of temperature as θ (Capital alphabet of Greek letter θ), the dimension of electric current as I, the dimension of luminous intensity as J and the dimension of amount of substance as N. We can verify the validity of any equation or formula by analyzing dimension. For S = ut + 1 2 at2 We know that addition, subtraction or equivalence are possible for any same kind of quantities. Hence every term of an equation must indicate the same kind of quantity, that is, the dimension of every term must be the same. Now there are three terms in the above equation, one to the left and two to the right. In this equation, s is displacement : its dimension is L, u is initial velocity; its dimension is L/T = LT-1 , a is acceleration ; its dimension is L/T 2 = LT-2 , t is time ; its dimension is T. ∴The dimension is ut = LT-1 x T = L The dimension of at2 = LT-2 x T2 = L Thus it is seen that the dimension of each of the term on both sides of the above equation is the same L. Therefore, the equation is valid.

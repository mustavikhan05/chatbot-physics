The range of vision of a normal eye is 25 cm to infinite distance. This means that normal eye can see any object at a distance between 25 cm to infinity. An eye which is unable to see any object distinctly within this distance that eye is a defective eye. Usually an eye has two kinds of defects. These are: 156 Physics 1. Short sight or Myopia 2. Long sight or Hypermetropia 1. Short sight or Myopia: If anybody has this problem, he or she cannot see any distant object distinctly but can see anything of near distance distinctly. Sometimes the distance of near point for such an eye is less than 25 cm. Therefore, if the near point of the eye is less than 25cm then that is also considered as short sight. Cause: This defect may be caused if the radius of the eye ball increases or if the focal length decreases for any reason and thereby increases the power of convergence of the eye lens. [Figure 9.22 (a) ] Effects of such problem: In this case, rays of light coming from any object placed at large distance, after refraction through the eye lens converge to a point I in front of the retina (Fig. 9.22 a). As a result, objects are not seen distinctly. For this kind of eye, the far point is not situated at infinity. Rather, it is a certain finite point F. For this reason, such type of eye cannot see object distinctly placed beyond F (Fig 9.22(b) ] Remedy: It has been said earlier that such type of defect arises due to the increase in the power of convergence of the eye lens. To remedy this defect, we need to decrease the power of convergence of the eye lens. For doing this, concave lens is used as aid lens or as spectacles. Besides, only a concave lens can create a virtual, erect and diminished image at a position nearer than that of the object. Therefore, to rectify short sight, a concave lens or spectacles should be used as aid lens in front of the eye. They

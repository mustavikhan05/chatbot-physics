Gravity : Every particle of this universe attracts towards each other. The force of attraction between any two bodies or particles in this universe is called ``Gravitation’’. If earth is one of the two bodies, then the force of attractions is called gravity, that is, the attraction of the earth on any other body is called gravity. There is a law of Newton about this attraction between any two bodies of the universe is known as Newton’s law of gravitation. We know from the Newton’s second law of motion that when a force acts on a body, it acts acceleration. So, acceleration of a body is produced due to the force of gravity as well. This acceleration is called acceleration due to gravity. 40  Physics The rate of increase of velocity of a freely falling body on earth due to force of gravity is called the acceleration due to gravity. The acceleration due to gravity is represented by the letter g. The quantities of magnitude of `g’ any place on earth is

Complete vibration: If a wave transmitting particle moves from a certain point and again comes back to the same point then the motion is called complete vibration. Figure: 7.4 Figure: 7.5 Figure: 7.6 down up motion of wave rope direction of wave direction of vibration contraction expansion Physics  117 Time period: The time interval in which the wave is repeated that is the times required for one complete vibration of a wave transmitting particle is known as its time period. It is expressed by the letter T and its unit is second (s).  Frequency: The number of complete vibrations in one second of a wave transmitting particle is known as its frequency. Wave is produced from a vibrating object. So the frequency of vibrating object is equal to the frequency of the wave. The unit of frequency is Hertz (Hz). If a vibrating particle executes one complete vibration in one second then its frequency is called 1 Hz. It is expressed by ‘ƒ’.  The relation between frequency and time period is ƒ = T 1 Amplitude: To produce a wave the particles need to vibrate about their equilibrium position. The maximum displacement of a wave transmitting particle from the position of equilibrium is called amplitude. In the figure ‘a’ is amplitude.

placed at the near point of a normal eye, after refraction through the eye lens converge to a point I behind the retina [Fig. 9.23 (a)]. As a result, the image becomes blurred. The near point N of such an eye shifts away to O, which is more than 25 cm (the distance of the near point for a normal eye). Therefore, such a defective eye cannot see any objects distinctly, which is placed nearer to O [Fig 9.23 (b)]. Figure: 9.22 Figure: 9.23 Physics  157 Remedy: It is already said that such defect of eye arises due to the decrease in the power of convergence of the eye lens. Therefore, to rectify the defect, the power of convergence of the eye lens should be increased. For this, convex lens of suitable focal length i.e. of suitable power should be used as aid lens or spectacles. We also know that only a convex lens can provide a virtual and erect image at a distance greater than that of the object. For this reason, a convex lens of suitable focal length or power is used in this case as aid lens or spectacles in front of the eye. The focal length of this lens should be such so that due to the refraction the virtual image of an object placed at normal near point N, is formed at the near point O of the defective eye.

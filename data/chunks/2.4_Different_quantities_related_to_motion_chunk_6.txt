same. The magnitude of the velocity of a body is its speed. The specific directional speed is its velocity. If the magnitude and direction of the velocity of a moving body remains unchanged, then the velocity of the body as called uniform or equal velocity. The velocity of sound is a good example of natural phenomenon of uniform velocity. Sound travels in a definite direction over equal distances in equal intervals of time and it is 332ms-1 in Air at 00c. Sound travels in a definite direction through a distance of 332m in the 1st second, 332m in the 2nd second and so on for every second. Here the magnitude and the direction of the velocity of sound remains the same. So the velocity of sound 332ms-1 is a uniform velocity. If the magnitude or direction or both of the velocity of a moving body changes during its motion, then its velocity is called variable or uniform velocity. In other words if the body does not move through equal distance in equal intervals of time or changes its direction of motion while moving then its velocity will be variable. Usually we moving, car runs on the road etc. are the uniform velocity. Acceleration and Retardation : If a body does not move with uniform velocity then the magnitude or direction or both of the velocity may change. We say that there is acceleration of a body if its velocity changes. Suppose a car is moving along a straight Fig-2.4 N S W E Physics

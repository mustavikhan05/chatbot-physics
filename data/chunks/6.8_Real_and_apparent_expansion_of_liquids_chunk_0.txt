Liquid always has to be heated keeping it in a container. The liquid as well as the container expand when heat is applied. So, the expansion of the liquid observed by us is not the real expansion but it is an apparent expansion. There are two types of expansions of liquids- a. Real expansion b. Apparent expansion Real expansion: If it had been possible to heat a liquid without keeping it in a vessel then the real expansion of the liquid that would be obtained is called real expansion of the liquid. But heating a liquid without a container is not possible. So, considering the expansion of the container the actual expansion of the liquid that is obtained is called the real expansion. It is expressed by Vr. Apparent expansion: The expansion of liquid apparently observed without considering the expansion of the container is called the apparent expansion of liquid. It is denoted by Va. Relation between real expansion and apparent expansion: A glass bulb with a long graduated stem is filled with liquid up to the mark A. Now keeping an eye on the liquid column the bulb is heated and it is observed that the upper level of the liquid comes down from position A to position B. After that it moves up from the graduated line B crossing the mark A and reaches to mark C. The reason is that when heat is applied the volume of the bulb increases at first. Due to this cause liquid comes down to B from A. Later on as soon as the liquid gets heated its volume starts to increase and reaches from B to C. It happens so as the expansion of liquid is more than the expansion of solid. Apparently it appears to us that the liquid was at mark A and finally reaches to mark C. Therefore, CA is the apparent expansion. CB is the real expansion and AB indicates the expansion of the container. From figure it is observed that, CB = CA+AB or, Real expansion = Apparent expansion + expansion of the container

which maintain the accounts of spent electrical energy. Throughout the world, the electricity supply authority measures the amount of electrical energy consumed in units of kilowatt-hour (kWh). We call this kilowatt-hour unit as ‘board of trade’ unit or in brief ‘unit’. From the difference of the readings of two times in the electricity meter, we get the amount of consumed electric power during this period. Since power, P = Work done time = Converted energy time W t = ∴ W Pt =  If P=1 kW and t =1h, then W=1 kW×1h=1 kWh. Therefore, the amount of electrical energy converted or spent when an electric device of 1 kilowatt power works for 1 hour is called 1 kilowatt-hour or 1 unit. Do yourself: Express 1kWh in terms of joule. 1 kWh = 3.6× 106 J When power is expressed in watt and time in hour, the amount of electrical energy consumed can be expressed as: W Pt = Wh Dividing this by 1000, the electricity consumed is found to be in kWh. Physics  191 Do yourself: If there is an electrical connection in the house you are dwelling in, then prepare a list of the electric devices those are in that house. From this, determine the probable amount of electrical energy to be consumed for one month. filament resistance?  What amount of electricity will flow through it? We know,  2 V P R =   2 V R P =  = 220 V × 220 V 100 W  = 484 Ω Again, P VI =   P I V =  =  100 W 220 V = 0.455 A Answer: 484 Ω  and 0.455 A

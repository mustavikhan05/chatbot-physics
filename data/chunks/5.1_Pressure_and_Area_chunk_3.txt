body is m and its volume is V, then density ρ = m V = mass of the body volume of the body The unit of density is kgm-3. Task: Take two jugs of equal volume. Fill up one jug with water and the other with honey. Lift both the jugs by your hands. Which one is felt heavier? The jug filled with honey will appear heavier because the density of honey is more. 200×10 -4 m 2 490N 90 Physics Some substances and their density Substances Density (kg-3) Substances Density (kg-3) Air 1.29 Water (at 4°C) 1000 Cork 250 Iron 7,800 Glycerin 1260 Silver 10,500 Ice 920 Gold 19,300  Of course you have heard the name of Dead Sea. It is in Jordan. Due to Salt and other impurities the density of the water of the sea is so high that man does not get sunk into it. Uses of density in every day life: The balloons are released in different inaugural ceremonies. The balloons are puffed of by hydrogen gas. The density of hydrogen is considerably less than the density of air. So, these light balloons filled with gas go up easily. When electricity goes off many of us use IPS and huge battery is used in an IPS. This type of battery known as storage cell is also used in cars and microphones. Sulphuric acid used in these cells has density ranging from 1.5x103kgm-3 to 1.3x103kgm-3. Sometimes, hydrometer is used to measure the density. The cell will damage if the density of acid increases. For this reason necessary amount of water is added to it time to time to keep the density at desired level. Eggs sink in water, but rotten eggs remain floating. As the density of the rotten egg is less than the water, it floats on water Mathematical example 5.2: what is the density of liquid of mass 2000kg and volume 2m3? We know, Density,ρ =

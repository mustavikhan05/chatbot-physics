faster. Power is the rate of doing work or transformation of energy. Power of a person or a source is measured by the amount of work done per unit time. Power = Work Time If as person or a device can do W amount of work or transform energy at time t then the power P will be, P = (4.4) Power has no direction. So it is a scalar quantity. Dimension: The dimension of power is the dimension of . Power = Work Time  = Force x Displacement Time = Mass x Acceleration x Displacement Time  = Mass x Displacement x Displacement Time x Time2 = Mass x Displacement2 Time3  âˆ´ [P] = ML2 T3

scale and n the number of vernier divisions. As mentioned above, s = 1 mm and n = 10 divisions ∴ Vernier constant = s / n = 1mm / 10 = 0.1mm = 0.01cm. Sometimes 20 vernier scale divisions are equal to 19 smallest main scale divisions and the smallest main scale division is less than 1mm. Then the vernier constant becomes difference. The vernier constant depends on the characteristics of marking the main scale and the vernier scale. Physics  15 Slide Calipers : The other name of slide calipers is venire calipers. Because the Venire’s method is used for the measurement with this instrument. The main scale of the slide calipers is made of a graduated rectangular still plate. A metal jaw is fixed at the starting end of the main scale, that is, at the end marked 0 of the main scale. A Jawed small scale is put over the body of the main scale, to measure fraction of the small division of the main scale accurately. It is called venire scale.

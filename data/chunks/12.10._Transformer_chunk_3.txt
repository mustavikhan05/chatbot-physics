is proportional to the number of turns. For a step up transformer ns > np and for a step down transformer ns < np. If no energy is dissipated in the transformer core, the energy input to the primary coil is wholly transferred to the secondary coil. Therefore, voltage of the primary coil x current of primary coil = Voltage of secondary coil x current of secondary coil i.c. Ep Ip = Es Is Therefore, Ep Es = Is Ip 12.2 This equation suggests that the rate at which a transformer reduces the voltage is exactly equal to the rate at which it increase the current so that the total power remains constant. Therefore, a transformer transforms both the voltage and the current. For transmission of electric power over long distances step up transformer is used. Step down transformer is used for domestic power supply such as radio, television, tape recorder, VCR, VCP, electric watch etc. Figure: 12.12 a Figure: 12.12 b 206  Physics Mathematical example: 12.1: In a transformer, the voltage of primary coil is 10V and current 6A.If the voltage of secondary coil is 20 V; calculate the current of secondary coil. We know:  Ip Is Es Ep =   Or, Is= A V A V Ip Es Ep 3 20 6 10 = × = ×   Ans: 3A  Mathematical example: 12.2.The number of turns of primary coil in a transformer is 50, voltage 210V. If the number of turns in the secondary coil is 100, what will be the voltage? We know: Ep Es = np ns  Es = ns np × Ep  = 100 50

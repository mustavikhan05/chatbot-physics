We know electric current is the flow of electrons. When the electrons move within the bulk of a conductor, they collide with the atoms and molecules of the conductor. Due to this their motion is resisted and electric current is obstructed. This property of a conductor is called resistance. At particular temperature, Resistance, V R I =  = Potential difference of two ends Electric current  The SI unit for resistance is ohm. It is expressed by the capital letter omega (Ω).  1 Ω is the resistance of a conductor through which a current of 1A flows when a potential difference of 1 V is applied across it. Resistors: A resistor is a conductor used in a circuit that has a known value of resistance. The main objective of using resistors is to control the quantity of the current flowing in a circuit. There are two types of resistors that are used in a circuit. These are: 1. Fixed resistors 2. Variable resistors 1. Fixed resistors: The fixed resistors are those who have fixed values of resistance. The fixed resistors that are generally used in laboratory are shown in figure 11.5.  Figure: 11.5 Here, Electric current, I = 4 A Potential difference, V = 12 V Resistance, R =? Physics  181 2. Variable resistors:  The variable resistors are those whose value of the resistance can be changed according to the necessity. These are called rheostat too. A rheostat is included in a circuit to vary the current flowing through it. Figure 11.6 shows a rheostat commonly used in the laboratories.

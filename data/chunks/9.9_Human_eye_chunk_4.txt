eye is 25 cm away from the eye. It is difficult for our eyes to see any object clearly that stays closer to this distance. Again, the distance which is maximum from the eye to see an object is called the farthest distance of distinct vision. It is also called the far point of the eye. The far point of any normal eye is at infinity. This means that a normal eye can see up to a huge distance. Physics 155 Persistence of vision: If any object is placed before our eyes an image of the object is formed in our retina. As a result of it, we see the object. For any reason, if the object is removed from our eyes, a sensation of that object stays in our brain for about 0.1 second. This period is called the persistence of vision. Advantage of having two eyes: If we see an object by our two eyes we can only see a single object. Though each eye forms individual images on their own retinas but the brain combines the two images to make a single one. We can measure the distance accurately for having two eyes. So, it is very difficult to thread a needle keeping one eye closed. Apart from that, due to the relative position of our eyes with respect to the object we see the right portion of the object better with our right eye and the left portion better with our left eye. If we see an object by our two eyes the superimposition of two images will happen and we will be able to see the object clearly.

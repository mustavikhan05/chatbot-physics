of the building running slowly, walking fast, walking normally and walking slowly and measure the time respectively. 8. Find your power in every case according to the table below. Table of observation Your mass, m= ….. kg Height of the roof, h =…..m Acceleration due to gravity, g = 9.8 ms-2 Readings Nature of running Time required to reach the roof, t (s) Power= (W) 1 Running fast 2 Running slowly 3 Walking fast 4 Walking normally 5 Walking slowly 9. Why your powers are different at different times? Explain 10. Obtained in the same way compare your power with the power of your friends. 11. Write down the names of five students of your class having the highest and lowest power. Investigation 4.2 Production of biogas from bio-mass. Objective: Demonstration of the uses of renewable energy. mgh t Physics  85 Apparatus and materials: Cow-dung, husk of rice, dust of wood, big bottle of plastic or glass (or conical flux if available in lab) , cork, tube etc. Working procedure: 1. Mix cow-dung, husg , wood dust and water in the bottle in proportion 1:2 2. Now close the mouth of the bottle or flux with the tube attached cork. 3. Close the mouth of the tube by a cork also. 4. Put the bottle or flux at the corner of a house. 5. After two or three days open the cork of the bottle and observe if gas is emitting or not. 6. If gas emits hold a fire stick at the mouth of the bottle. 7. Gas will burn.  Exercise Multiple choice questions: 1. Which is the unit of work? a) Joule   b) Newton c) Kelvin   d) Watt 2.

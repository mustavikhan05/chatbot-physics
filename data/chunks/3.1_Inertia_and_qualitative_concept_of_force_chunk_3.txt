reason? It happens due to the weight or attraction of the earth on the body. We define this force as the force of gravitation. In this way we feel the existence of different type of forces in different events of nature. For example- the magnetic force between two poles of a magnet, the electrical force between two charged bodies, nuclear force within the nucleus. Now we will see how we can get concept about inertia and force from Newton’s first law of motion. Newton’s first law of motion is- ‘Every object will continue in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless an external force is applied to it.’ Newton’s first law expresses the property of inertia of matter. From Newton’s first law of motion we observe that a body cannot change its state on its own. If the body is at rest, it tends to remain at rest forever and if it is in motion it tends to keep on motion with uniform speed for all time. This property of a body is termed as inertia. Thus from the Newton’s first law of motion we get the concept of inertia. Again from Newton’s first law we see that to change the state of a body something external must be applied. That is, the external cause which changes or tends to change the state of an object is called force. Thus from Newton’s first law we get qualitative definition of force. According to Newton’s first law, a force is that which acting on a body at rest produces or tends to produce motion or acting on a moving body changes or tends to change its state of motion. Physics

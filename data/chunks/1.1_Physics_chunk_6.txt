4 Physics determination of relations among them are the basic foundation of scientific works. Galileo introduced the scientific trends of developing mathematical theory and verifying its authenticity through experiment. Later, Newton (1642-1727 A.D) gave it a complete shape. Galileo defined displacement, motion, acceleration, time etc. and determined relations among them. Consequently he discovered the laws of falling bodies and established the foundation of statics. Newton by his versatile genius discovered mechanics and the three famous laws of mechanics and law of universal gravitation. He also made contribution for optics, heat and sound. He invented calculus, a new branch of mathematics. The discovery and inventions of the eighteenth and nineteenth century paved the way for Europe to industrial revolution. The steam engine of James Watt (1736-1819 A.D) played a vital role for industrial revolution. Hans Christian Oersted (1777-1851 A.D) demonstrated the magnetic effect of current. This discovery led Michael Faraday (1791- 1867 A.D), Henry (1797-1879 A.D) and Lenz (1804-1865 A.D) towards discovering the fact that magnetic effect produces electric current. In fact, this was a discovery of the process of converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. In 1864 James Clark Maxwell (1831-1879 A.D) demonstrated that light is one kind of electromagnetic wave. He established the electromagnetic theory by combining electric and magnetic field. Similar kind of radiation was also discovered and produced in 1888 by Heinrich Hertz (1857-1894 A.D). Using the same kind of waves in

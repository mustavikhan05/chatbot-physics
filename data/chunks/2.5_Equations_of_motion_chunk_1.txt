know the value of three, we can find the value of other two. So there are four equations and every equations has four quantities we can find the value of unknown quantities using the values known quantities by this equation. In lesson 2.4 we see Acceleration, a = v-u t ∴ v = u + at (2.1) 38 Physics We also find there average speed = distance traveled time or, u+v 2 = s t ∴ s = (u+v)t 2 (2.2)   ∴ s = ut + 1 2  at2        (2.3)     ∴ v2  = u2 + 2as

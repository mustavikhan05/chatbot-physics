through the water with the help of this machine and if this sound returns being reflected from the bottom of the ocean, it is received by the receiver of the machine. If the recorded time of transmitting and receiving is subtracted then the time of traveling is found. Suppose this time is t and the depth of the ocean is d. If the velocity of sound in the water is v, then it = vt or, d = vt 2 (7.3) The summation of the distance travelled during return and transmission of sound is d+d = 2d. By knowing the velocity of sound, the depth of ocean can be measured with the help of the above equation. To clear the dirt of clothes: The clothes can be washed by the modern washing machine. Mixing soap or powder soap with water the clothes are soaked in it then ultrasonic sound is passed through it. This sound removes the dirt from the clothes and they are cleaned. To diagnose disease: As the internal photograph of human body can be captured by X- ray, in the same way the disease can also be identified by capturing picture through ultrasonic sound. This process is known as Ultrasonography. This sound is transmitted inside the body and the reflected sound is converted into light energy and casted on the television screen. As a result, the disease can be identified. In medical science: Ultrasonic sound is used for scaling the teeth or to remove the stones from teeth. Ultrasonic sound is also used to remove small stones from kidney by turning them into dust. For other uses: Ultrasonic sound is used to find out fine cracks in metal blocks or metal sheets, to clean tiny electronic machines and also to destroy the harmful germs. The uses of infrasonic sound: The range of infrasonic sound is from 1 Hz to 20 Hz. Men cannot hear this sound but some animals can hear it. Elephants communicate with each other using infrasonic sound. This sound can travel a long distance without any  Figure: 7.15 Physics

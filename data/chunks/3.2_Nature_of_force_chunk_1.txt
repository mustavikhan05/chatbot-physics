called non-contact force. The attractive gravitational force between two bodies, the attractive or repulsive electric force between two charged bodies, the attractive or repulsive force between two poles of two magnets, the force of attraction acting between a magnet and a magnetic material are the examples of non-contact force or distant force. Do yourself: Release a pen or pencil or any object from your hand. The body will fall down. Something is pulling the body downward certainly. Who is pulling? Here, the earth is pulling the body towards it, though there is no direct connection between the body and the earth i.e. the earth is not in contact with the body. Here the earth is applying force of gravitation on the body. The force of gravitation is a non-contact force. Any two body of the universe exert force of gravitation on each other. When the earth exerts force of gravitation on another body, then this force is called gravity. Though we observe different kinds of force in nature, fundamental force are of four types. Rest of them is some forms of these fundamental forces. The forces which are root or independent i.e. the forces which are not produced from some other forces or not any forms of some other forces are called fundamental forces. Instead, other forces are some forms of these fundamental forces. 52

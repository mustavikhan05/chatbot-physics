who goes faster. The quantity by which we can measure how fast a body moves or distance traveled, is called speed. Speed expresses the rate of change position of a body. The rate of change of position of a body with time is called the speed. Speed of a body is measured by the distance traveled per unit time. i.e Speed = distance time If a moving body travels a distance `d’ in time `t’ then the speed v is The direction of rate of change of position of the body cannot be known by the speed. So it has no direction. Therefore, speed is a scalar quantity.  Physics  33 The dimension of speed is the dimension of = distance time ∴ [ V ] = [ L / T ] = [ LT-1 ] As speed is obtained by the division of distance and time, unit of speed is obtained, by the division of units of distance and time. Since the unit of distance is meter (m) and unit of time is second (s), unit of speed is meter/second (ms-1). The speed of a body is 4ms-1 means that the body moves a distance of 4m in 1second. Though the unit of speed is meter/second, for our convenience sometimes we consider the unit of speed is kilometer/hour where the unit of distance is kilometer and of time is hour. The speedometer of car measures the speed in kmh-1 . Average Speed : If the magnitude of speed does not change during the motion of the body, that is if the body travels equal distance in equal interval of time, then the speed of the body is called uniform speed. And if the body does not travel equal distance in equal interval of time then the speed is called non uniform speed. If a body does not move with uniform speed, then the speed obtained by dividing the total distance traveled by time is called average speed. So, average speed =

Work means to do something in our everyday life but in science doing anything is not work. In science the term work represents a definite concept. A gateman guards a house all day long sitting at a place and can say he has done his work. A boat was floating with the current of a river or canal and Mr. Karim was pulling it back. He might say he has done work to hold the boat otherwise the current of the river could pull it away. These are recognized as work in our daily life but these are not work in the point of view of science. Rather had the gateman guarded the house walking instead of sitting or had the boat floated with the current of the river, work could have been done. The concept of work in science is different from that of daily life. In fact in science work is done when displacement is associated with force. So, if a force acts on a body and causes its displacement only then work is said to be done. We see many examples of work around us in our daily life. For example, bull pulls the plough; a laborer pushes forward a push cart, someone throws iron sphere is sports competition etc. Let us consider the following examples: a) Ratan is standing still with a packet of book in his hand. b) Mita is pushing her physics book from one end to another of a table. c) Niru is lifting a heavy bag through stairs. d) Rimi is pushing the wall strongly. As work is said to be done only when a force is acted on a body and displaces it, so in the above examples (b) and (c) work is done but in the example (a) and (d) no work is done. We can apply force to shift a body from one place to another. We can change the shape of any body by applying force. In these cases work is done. If a construction

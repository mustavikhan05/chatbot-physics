flowing through each of the resistors owing to their different values. The main current I of the circuit splits into three parts at the junction a and later recombine at the point b. Let I1, I2 and I3 are the currents flowing through the resistances R1, R2 and R3 respectively. Therefore, sum of the currents I1, I2 and I3 of parallel paths is equal to the current I at the junction a. Therefore, I = I1 + I2 + I3 (11.7) Here, the potential difference between the two terminals being V, applying Ohm’s law we get, 188  Physics  1 1 , V I R =  2 2 V I R = and 3 3 V I R =  Substituting the values of I1, I2 and I3 in equation (11.7) we get,  1 2 3 V V V I R R R = + +   1 2 3 1 1 1 ( ) V R R R = + +    (11.8) Now if three resistances R1, R2 and R3 are replaced by a single resistance RP, so that same current I flows through the circuit and the potential difference V across them remains unchanged, then RP is the equivalent resistance of the combination. ∴ P V I R =

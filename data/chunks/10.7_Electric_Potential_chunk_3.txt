will be, V= Electric potential determines in which direction the flow of electric charge takes place when two charged conductors are electrically connected. If two positively charged metallic spheres are connected by conducting wire (fig:10.12) then any of the following phenomena may occur. 1. Some charge from the left sphere may go to the right sphere. 2. Some charge from the right sphere may go to the left sphere. 3. The charges may remain as it is. W q 168

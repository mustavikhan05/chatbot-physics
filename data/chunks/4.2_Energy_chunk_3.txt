the pen move and the pen obtains the ability to work that is kinetic energy is produced in it. So it could displace the object. Creating velocity in a body in rest or increasing the velocity of a moving object means to produce acceleration in it. For this force has to be applied. As a result work will be done on the body. For this the body will obtain the ability to work and this work will be stored 72 Physics in the object as kinetic energy. This is why all moving objects are in possession of kinetic energy. The body will be able to perform this amount of work before it rests. Let a force F be applied on a body of mass m at rest. The body attains a velocity v. Suppose the body moves a distance s in the direction of the force. The work done to produce this velocity of the body is its kinetic energy. Therefore, Kinetic energy = Work done  = Force × displacement  = F × s or,

recorded the magnitude velocity i.e. speed of the car from the speedometer after every 5min throughout the journey. The magnitude of velocity he got per hour was 18, 36, 54, 45, 54, 36, and 18 kilometer. a) What is instantaneous speed ? b) Explain the acceleration of an object moving with uniform velocity. c) Find the distance traveled by the car in first 5min. d) Draw and explain the velocity-time graph by the collected data. 48 Physics Chapter three FORCE [Sir Isaac Newton has done a lot of research about the motion of an object. He expressed the fundamental principles of motion by three laws. In this chapter we shall discuss about these laws of motion. In addition, the inertia of a object, force, nature of force, momentum, friction and safe journey will also be discussed.] By the end of this chapter we will be able to- 1. Explain the inertia of an object and qualitative concept of force applying Newton’s first law of motion. 2. Explain the nature of different types of forces. 3. Explain the influence of balanced and unbalanced forces. 4. Explain the momentum and collision of objects. 5. Analyze the influence of force on motion and shape of an object. 6. Measure the force by applying Newton’s second law of motion. 7. Explain the action and reaction force by applying Newton’s third law of motion. 8. Analyze the influence of motion and force on safe travelling. 9. Explain different types of friction and frictional forces. 10.  Analyze the influence of friction on the motion of an object. 11.  Describe the means to increase or decrease friction. 12.  Explain the positive impact of friction in our daily life.

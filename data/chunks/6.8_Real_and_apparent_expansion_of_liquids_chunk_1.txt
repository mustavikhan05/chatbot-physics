to increase and reaches from B to C. It happens so as the expansion of liquid is more than the expansion of solid. Apparently it appears to us that the liquid was at mark A and finally reaches to mark C. Therefore, CA is the apparent expansion. CB is the real expansion and AB indicates the expansion of the container. From figure it is observed that, CB = CA+AB or, Real expansion = Apparent expansion + expansion of the container ∴Vr = Va + Vg … … … (6.5)

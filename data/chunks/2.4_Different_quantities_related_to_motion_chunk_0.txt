Distance and Displacement: Suppose, Ovi ran 100m from his school gate. It is true that Ovi is 100m away from the gate, but it does not tell the exact position of Ovi. Because Ovi can be 100m away to the east, to the west, to the north, to the south or any other directions. To know exactly the change of position of Ovi, the direction towards which he moved 100m should also be known. If it is stated that Ovi ran 100m from the gate to the east then his exact position will be known definitely. If you go straight to the east from the gate you will find Ovi at a distance of 100m. The physical quantity which was first used to indicate the change of position of Ovi is distance. This is a scalar quantity. In the second case, direction has also been mentioned along with distance, this is called displacement. This is a vector quantity. Change of position or distance in a definite direction is displacement. So, the change of position of an object with respect to its surrounding in a definite direction is called displacement. The minimum distance, that is, the linear distance between the initial and final position of a body is the magnitude of its displacement at its direction is towards final position from the initial position. The displacement does not depend on the path of the object. An object can move from position A to position B following different paths. But its displacement will be from A Fig-2.2 Fig-2.3 W E S N 32

used to measure the density. The cell will damage if the density of acid increases. For this reason necessary amount of water is added to it time to time to keep the density at desired level. Eggs sink in water, but rotten eggs remain floating. As the density of the rotten egg is less than the water, it floats on water Mathematical example 5.2: what is the density of liquid of mass 2000kg and volume 2m3? We know, Density,œÅ = mass/volume

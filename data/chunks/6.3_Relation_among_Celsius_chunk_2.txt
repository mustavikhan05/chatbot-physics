are kept side by side. The readings of the point P of the thermometer AB in other three scales are C, F and K respectively. Therefore the readings of distance PA in these three scales are C-0, F-32 and K-273 respectively. Since PA BA is a constant it can be written, PA BA = C-0 100-0 = F-32 212-32 = K-273 373-273 or, C 100 = F-32 180 = K-273 100 or, C 5 = F-32 9 = K-273 5 (6.1) Equation (6.1) indicates the relation among Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin scale. The convenient relation between Celsius and Kelvin scale is – by adding 273 to Celsius scale reading the Kelvin scale reading can be obtained. For example, 1°C temperature = (1+273) K = 274 K temperature. But if the temperature difference is 1K, then it is equal to 1°C. Mathematical example 6.1:The temperature of body of a healthy man is 98.4°F. What would be the reading in Celsius scale? We know, C 5 =  F-32 9 or, C 5 = 98.4-32 9  or, C = 36.89 °C Ans: 36.89 °C

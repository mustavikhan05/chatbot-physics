atmospheric pressure? 4. Is Torricelliâ€™s vacuum is a vacuum in reality? Explain. 5. Establish a relation between pressure and height of liquid. Water level after immersion of body Water level before immersion of body 100 Physics Chapter six EFFECT OF HEAT ON SUBSTANCES [Heat is a form of energy related to the motion of molecules of substances. Temperature is an indicator to indicate the direction at which heat energy will flow. By the application or elimination of heat, shape of solid, volume of liquid and volume and pressure of gasses are changed. Application or removal of heat transforms a substance from one state to another. Such effects of heat on substances will be discussed in this chapter.] By the end of this chapter, we will be able to - 1. Explain heat and temperature. 2. Explain the thermal properties of matter. 3. Analyze the relationship among Fahrenheit, Celsius and Kelvin scale. 4. Explain the increase in temperature with the increase of internal energy of the substances. 5. Explain the thermal expansion of substances. 6. Explain the expansion in length, area and volume of a solid. 7. Explain the real and apparent expansion of liquid. 8. Explain the effect of heat in changing the state of matter. 9. Explain melting, vaporization and condensation. 10. Explain melting and boiling point. 11. Explain the effect of pressure on melting point. 12. Explain boiling and evaporation. 13. Explain the latent heat of fusion and vaporization. 14. Explain the cooling effect of evaporation. 15. Explain the influence of factors on vaporization. 16. Explain specific heat and heat capacity. 17. Explain the principle of measurement of heat.  Physics  101

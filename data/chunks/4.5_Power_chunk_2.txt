. Power = Work Time = Force x Displacement Time = Mass x Acceleration x Displacement Time = Mass x Displacement x Displacement Time x Time2 = Mass x Displacement2 Time3 âˆ´ [P] = ML2 T3 = [ML2T-3] W t Work Time 82  Physics Unit: We can get the unit of power by dividing the unit of work with that of time. Since the unit of work is joule (J) and the unit of time is second (s), the unit of power will be Joule/second (J/s). It is called Watt. Watt is denoted by W. If one joule work is done in one second or the rate of transformation of energy is called one watt. 1W = 1J 1S

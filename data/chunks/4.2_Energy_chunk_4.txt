possession of kinetic energy. The body will be able to perform this amount of work before it rests. Let a force F be applied on a body of mass m at rest. The body attains a velocity v. Suppose the body moves a distance s in the direction of the force. The work done to produce this velocity of the body is its kinetic energy. Therefore, Kinetic energy = Work done = Force × displacement = F × s or, Ek = mas; [ as, F = ma]  Fig: 4.2 But,  v2 = u2 + 2as or, as = v2 2 ; [since, initial velocity, u = 0]  ∴ Ek = 1 2  mv2

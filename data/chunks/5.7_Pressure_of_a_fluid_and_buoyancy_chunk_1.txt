So, h = h2 – h1 The downward force acting on the surface PQ of the cylinder, F1 = Ah1ρg The upward thrust exerted by the liquid on the surface SR of the cylinder, F2 = Ah2ρg The lateral pressures experienced by the curved surface of the cylinder being equal and opposite of each other it become neutralized. ∴ Upward thrust or buoyancy = F2 – F1 = Ah2ρg – Ah1ρg = A (h2 – h1) ρg = Ahρg. = (hA)ρg = Vρg [ V = hA = volume of the cylinder] = weight of the displaced fluid by the cylinder. So, the upward thrust or buoyancy acting on a submersed body is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by it. For this upward thrust it seems that a submersed body losses weight. Figur: 5.7 94

point P [Fig 10.10] to the charged body A, the more will be the strength of electric field at that point. The strength of the electric field is called intensity. If at any point of an electric field a unit of positive charge is placed and the force that it acquires is called the electric intensity at that point. If the charge at point P acquires a force F, then the intensity of electric field at that point P, E= (10.2) Here, 1st charge, q1= 20C 2nd charge, q2= 50C Distance = 2m Force, F = ? q1q d2 Cq1q d2 F q Cq1q2 d2 9 x 109 Nm2C-2 x (20C x (2m)2 Figure: 10.10 166

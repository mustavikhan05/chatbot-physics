increase in surface area of copper is 33.4 10-6 m2. Initial length, l1 = 100m Final length, l2 = 100.033m Initial temperature, θ1 = 20°C Final temperature, θ2 = 50°C Increase of temperature (θ2 - θ1) = 30K Increase in length, (l2 – l1) = 0.033m Coefficient of linear expansion, α = ? l2 - l1 l1(θ2 - θ1) 0.033m 100m x 30K A2-A1 A1(θ2-θ1) Increase in surface area Initial area x increase of temperature Fig: 6.6 Fig: 6.5 106 Physics Volume Expansion and Coefficient of Volume Expansion: The volume of a solid substance increases if its temperature is increased. It is called volume expansion. Let, the initial volume of a substance be V1 and initial temperature be θ1. When the temperature is raised to θ2, its volume becomes V2 after being increased. There increase in volume is V2 – V1 and increase of temperature = θ2 - θ1. Now if the coefficient of volume expansion is represented by γ, then γ =

to lift a body of weight 10N at a height 5m. It uses electrical energy of 65J. a) What is the energy lost by the motor? b) Find the efficiency of the motor. Ans: a) Here, energy used = work done = Force x displacement = Weight x height = 10N x 5m = 50J ∴ The energy lost = Energy supplied – energy used = 65J – 50J = 15J b) Efficiency, η = x 100% = x 100% = 76.92%  Effective energy Total input energy Effective energy Total input energy 50J 65J 84  Physics Investigation 4.1: Determination of power of a student running up through a stair. Objective: Determination of power and the comparison of applied power at different times with the power of other. Apparatus: Stop watch Working procedure: 1. Fix a building (three to six storied building is better) that may be your school building or residence or any other building. 2. Count the number of steps of the stair to reach the roof. 3. Measure the height of a step by a scale and multiply it by the number of steps and find the total height of the roof. 4. Determine your mass by a weight measuring machine. 5. Reach the top of the roof as fast as possible. 6. Measure the time to reach the roof with the stop watch. 7. Now reach the roof of the building running slowly, walking fast, walking normally and walking slowly and measure the time respectively. 8. Find your power in every case according to the table below. Table of observation Your mass, m= ….. kg Height of the roof, h =…..m Acceleration due to gravity, g = 9.8 ms-2 Readings Nature of running Time required to reach the roof, t (s) Power= (W) 1 Running  fast   2 Running slowly   3 Walking  fast   4 Walking  normally   5 Walking slowly

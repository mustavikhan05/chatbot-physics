For a particular pair of transparent medium and a particular colour of light when ray of light refracts from one medium to another, then if the angle of incidence is i and the angle of refraction is r, then sin i sin r  will be a constant and it is called refractive index of the second medium with respect to the first medium for that colour of light. It is expressed by n.

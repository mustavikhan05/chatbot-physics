Suppose a loop or coil of wire like picture 12.8(a) is used between the two poles of magnet .As the loop has returned to the opposite direction from A to B, the opposite electricity will flow between the two half of the loop or coil. So, the wire will go to the upward in A and downward in B. For this the wire moves in clockwise. At the vertical position of the wire like figure 12.8(b) no force will act on it. For this it will be stopped. To keep the coil rotating, we will use a device named commutator. It consists of two Figure: 12.6 Physics  203 equal segments made of copper (see figure12.9). Each segment is connected to A and B respectively. The outer part of the separated segment makes a contact with the electric source through carbon brush. The segment moves with the coil and when itsâ€™ gap between two side remains opposite to the carbon brush, no current will flow. But despite this fact, the movement will remain continue for its inertia and it will get force newly when it will come to the contact of the moving brush. Thus the rotation will remain continue.

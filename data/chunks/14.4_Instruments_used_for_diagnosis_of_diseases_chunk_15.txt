into the patient’s body. The liquid is called ‘dye’ and the tube is called ‘catheter’. The blood vessels become visible on an X- ray due to the use of dye. This dye is later eliminated from the body through kidneys and urine. Through a definite entry point the catheter is introduced into a definite artery or vein. The entry point may be in any blood vessel of the body. Sometimes, the ‘dye’ used is also termed as ‘contrast’. 238 Physics Figure: 14.10 The causes for which the physicians generally recommend an angiogram are as follows- A. Blockages of the arteries outside the heart. B. Enlargement of the arteries C. For understanding the kidney artery conditions D. Problems with veins Sometimes the physicians can also treat a blockage in a blood vessel without any surgery during an angiogram. The mechanism or the procedure following which the blocked arteries are cleared during an angiogram is called angioplasty. Isotopes and its uses Isotopes are the variants of a definite element. Atoms of the same element having different mass number are called isotopes. That is, in isotopes of an element, the number of protons is same but the number of neutron is different. The number of protons in the nucleus of atom of an element identifies the element uniquely. But in principle, an element may have any number of neutrons. The total number of protons and neutrons present in the nucleus of an element is its mass number. For this reason, each isotope of an element has different mass number. Carbon can be considered as an example. Three isotopes of carbon 12 6C , 13 6C

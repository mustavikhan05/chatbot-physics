ohm’s law, I ∝ V ⇒ V R I = = constant This constant is called the resistance of the conductor at that temperature. or, V I R = Graph of V-I is shown in fig. 11.4 Fig: 11.14 180 Physics Mathematical Example11.1: A current of 4 A is flowing through the filament of the headlight of a motor car. If the potential difference between the two ends of the filament is 12 V, what is the resistance of it? We know  V I R =  or, V R I =

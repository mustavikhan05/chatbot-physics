Fig-9.1 Fig – 9.2 In figure 9.1 the incident ray is AB, the refracted ray is BC and NBN' is the normal drawn at point B on PQ. ∠ABN is called the angle of incidence i and ∠N'BC is called the angle of refraction r. Since the velocity of light differs from medium to medium, during the change of medium refraction takes place. When ray of light enters from a rarer medium (air) to a denser medium (glass) the refracted ray bends towards the normal i.e. in this case i>r again when it enters from a denser medium to a rarer medium it goes away from the normal i.e. in this case r>i. Do it: Put an ink mark on a white paper and place a transparent glass slab on it  The point O has raised at point O'. This happens because of refraction of light. The ray of light coming from O enters the rarer medium from denser medium. As a result the refracted ray goes away from the normal. If the refracted ray is extended backward it appears to come from O'. Here the point O' is the virtual image of the point O. If we look directly at the point O it seems to be raised at point O' (fig: 9.3).  air glass air glass 144  Physics

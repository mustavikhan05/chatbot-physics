What is the height the boy reached on? c) What is the work done to reach the roof? d) What is the power he used to reach the roof? 4. It is more advantageous to produce nuclear energy than the power station that uses fuel because no green house gas is produced. a) What are the other advantages of using nuclear energy? b) What are the disadvantages of using nuclear energy? Physics 87 Chapter five PRESSURE AND STATES OF MATTER [We know matter can exist in three states- solid, liquid and gas. Plasma is another state of matter.  Liquids and gases can flow easily so they are called fluids. The fluid can create pressure. We can do many works using pressure of fluids. Elasticity is a special characteristic of matter. We will discuss all these in this chapter.] By the end of the chapter, we will be able to - 1. Explain the change of pressure with the change of force and area. 2. Explain the density. 3. Explain the usage of density in our everyday life. 4. Explain the atmospheric pressure. 5. Find the atmospheric pressure by using the height of the liquid column. 6.   Analyze the change of atmospheric pressure with the increase of height. 7. Analyze the effect of change of atmospheric pressure on weather. 8. Determine the expression for pressure at a point in a liquid at rest. 9. Explain the upward pressure of submerged body in liquid. 10. Explain why object floats on water. 11. Analyze the causes of accidents in waterway in Bangladesh. 12. Explain Pascal’s law. 13. Demonstrate practical application of Pascal’s law. 14. Explain stress and strain. 15. Explain Hooke’s law. 16. Explain the molecular kinetic theory of matter. 17. Explain the plasma state of matter.   88  Physics

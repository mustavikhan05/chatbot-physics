Explain.  c) Find the wavelength of sound.  d) Is it possible to hear echo at position S? Verify with mathematical logic. Figure 126  Physics Chapter eight REFLECTION OF LIGHT    [We see many things around us. When light comes directly to our eyes from any source, we can see the source. Again, when light emitted from a light source comes to our eyes after reflection from the surface of any object, we see the object too. Light is a kind of energy or external cause which enables us to see or creates the sense of vision in our eyes. In this chapter we will discuss about nature of light, mirrors, laws of reflection of light, types of mirror, how image is formed in a mirror, uses of mirror and magnification of images.] By the end of this chapter, we will be able to- 13. Explain nature of light. 14. Explain the laws of reflection of light. 15. Explain mirrors. 16. Explain images. 17. Explain formation of images in mirrors by drawing action line of light rays. 18. Explain some common phenomena of formation of images in plane and spherical mirrors. 19. Explain uses of mirrors. 20. Explain magnification. 21. Demonstrate formation of images. 22.  Realize the influence of different optical phenomena and their contributions in our life and appreciate them.   Physics  127

Friction is inextricably related to our daily lives. Friction can be increased in necessity; again friction can be decreased too in necessity. How friction can be decrease and increase would be discussed in this section. Reducing friction Smoothing the surface Friction makes many troubles to displace one body from one place to another. Let, you want to displace a massive box on the floor. If the friction of the contact surface is large enough, then it takes a lot of labor to displace it. By polishing or smoothing the surface it can be decreased. 64  Physics Using wheels There are wheels in bus, truck and many types of machinery. The wheel is an ingenious invention. Its circular shape reduces friction to a minimum. Without wheel was it possible to use this machinery?

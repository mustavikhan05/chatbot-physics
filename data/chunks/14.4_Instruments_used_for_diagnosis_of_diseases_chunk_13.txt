or proton beams are applied from outside the body. The beam is applied directing to that site of the body where the tumor is located. As a result, the growth and power of multiplication of the cancer cells get destroyed. In this process a very few number of healthy cells also get affected. Yet, our aim is to destroy cancer cells as many as possible than the healthy cells. Most of the healthy cells that got damaged can repair themselves. Figure 14.8: Radiotherapy machine In case of internal radiotherapy, radiotherapy is applied from inside the body of a patient. In this process patient takes radioactive liquids as drinks or radioactive liquids are introduced to the body of patient through injection. Radioactive phosphorus in case Physics  237 of blood cancer, radioactive strontium in bone cancer and radioactive iodine in thyroid cancer is used in the liquid. This process is called brachytherapy. ETT ETT is the short form of ‘Exercise Tolerance Test’. It is a test of the stimulated heart. Electric activities or functions (rate or rhythm) of the heart during exercise are recorded by ETT. In fact, it is an ECG test of the patient while doing exercise. This test is very important for identifying the diseases related to coronary artery. During this test, extra stress of exercise is imposed on the heart.

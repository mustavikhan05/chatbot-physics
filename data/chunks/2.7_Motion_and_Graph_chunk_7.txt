to first one just touching him without stopping your walk. Again touching first one go to the second one . Repeat it for several times. 6. Note down the characteristics of the motion mentioned in procedure 2 in your copy. 7. Write down the characteristics of motion in your copy mentioned in procedure 4. In this case the motion of all participants are circular and periodic. Example the causes why these motions are circular and periodic breaking the chain. 46 Physics 8.  Note down the characteristics of the motion mentioned in procedure 5. In this case motion of all participants are periodic and vibratory. Explain why this motion is periodic and vibratory 9.  By this observation compare various kinds of motion and write down their differences. Investigation: 2.3 Determination of speed of 100 meter race and its graphical analysis Objectives : To determine the average speed by the traveled distance in different times, draw distance-time graph determine instantaneous speed at any time and average acceleration. Apparatus : Meter scale, stopwatch, rope or measuring tape Working procedure : 1.  Stretch out a rope straightly at one end of the school play ground (Use any other field if there is no field in the school) 2.  Stretch another four ropes each 25 meter distance. So the final rope will be at 100 meter distance. 3.  Stand near the first rope and let your four friends stands by the four ropes with stopwatch. 4.  Start running with the whistle of your teacher and every one standing will start their stopwatch. 5.  When the runner will just cross the rope the respective person will stop his stopwatch. You will find the amount of time from the stopwatch. 6.  Find average speed by dividing the distance by time for that time interval. 7.  Draw a graph by plotting time (t) along X-axis and distance (d) along Y-axis. 8.  Determine the distance traveled at any time, average speed of that time interval and instantaneous speed of that moment from the graph. 9.

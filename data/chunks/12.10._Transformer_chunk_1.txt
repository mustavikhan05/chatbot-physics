The electrical device through which the high alternating potential can be changed into low alternating potential and low potential into high potential is called transformer. This device is made on the basis electromagnetic induction. There are two kinds of transformers. These are - 1. Step up Transformer: The transformer which converts an electric current of greater strength at a low voltage into an electric current of weaker value at high voltage is known as step up transformer. 2. Step down Transformer: The transformer which changes the high potential less electric current into low potential much electric current is step down transformer. Figure: 12.11 Physics  205 Construction : A transformer is made on a soft iron core in rectangular form in which two coils of insulated copper wire are inserted in its two opposite limbs (Fig 12.12) The coil in which an a.c. or emf is applied is known as primary coil. The coil in which an a.c or emf is induced is known as secondary coil. In step up transformer the number of turns in the secondary coil is greater than that in the primary coil. In step down transformer the number of turns in the secondary is less than that in the primary coil.  Let an a.c emf Ep be applicd to a primary coil np turns. A current Ip flows in this coil. This curent by magnetising the core produces magnetic lines of foorce that ultimately produces induced emf in the primary coil. If there is no diminution of the magnctic lines same number of magnetic lines remain associated with each turn of the sccondary coil. Consequently an emf is induced in the secondary coil. If the number of turns in the secondary coil be ns and the induced emf be Es, We have: Ep Es =  np ns

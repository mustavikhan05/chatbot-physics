mass of the body, m = 50 kg = 50 kg Ã— 4 ms-2 acceleration, a = 4 ms-2 = 200 kg ms-2    force, F =  ? = 200 N  Ans: 200  N Mathematical Example 3.2: A boy pushes a box of mass 20 kg with a force of 50 N. What will be the acceleration of the box? We know     Here, F ma =      mass of the box, m = 20 kg F a m =      applied force, F = 50 N  50 20 N kg =      acceleration of the box, a = ? = 2.5 ms-2      Ans: 2.5 ms-2  Physics  57

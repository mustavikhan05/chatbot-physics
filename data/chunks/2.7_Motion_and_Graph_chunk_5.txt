1. Take a plank long as possible 2. Place brick or book under one end to make it high. So the plank will be inclined with the horizontal 3. Hold a marble at the upper end of the plank and then start the stopwatch the moment you release the marble. Stop the stopwatch the moment it strikes the ground 4. Find the average speed dividing the distance i.e. the length of the plank the marble travels by this time 5. Place more bricks or books at the upper end to make it higher i.e. to make it more sloppy 6.  Again find the average speed measuring the time the marble requires to strike the ground. 7.  Similarly measure the average speed for different slope of the plank.

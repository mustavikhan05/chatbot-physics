equal in all respects. Hence, OT = TI The image I in a plane mirror is at the same distance behind the mirror as the object O is in front. (B) Extended object The image of an extended object can also be drawn as the point object. In this case, the extended object should be considered as an aggregation of infinite number of points. Here, a virtual image is formed for each point behind the mirror [Figure 8.13]. 134 Physics Figure: 8.13 In the figure an object AO and its image BI are shown. From the points O and A, perpendiculars are drawn on the mirror M1M2. They intersect the mirror at the points R and L. Now OR and AL are extended backward to the points I and B respectively, such that OR=IR and AL=BL. Two rays from each of the points O and A incident obliquely on the mirror and get reflected. When the two reflected rays are produced backward, they seem to be coming from the points I and B respectively. Now I and B are joined. Therefore, BI is the virtual image of the object AO formed in the plane mirror. The size of the image formed in a plane mirror is always equal to that of the object. The characteristics of the image formed in a plane mirror. The images formed by a plane mirror have the following properties: 1. The image in a plane mirror is at the same distance as the object is in front. 2. The size of the image is equal to the size of the object. 3. The image is virtual and erect. Images formed in a spherical mirror If an object is placed in front of a spherical mirror, that may be concave or convex, an image of the object is formed in the mirror. To know the position, size and nature of the image, we have to know the direction of the reflected beam of light emitted by an object. We can draw an image in a spherical mirror considering any two of the three rays described below. 1. Rays incident along the radius of curvature returns back along the same path after reflection in a spherical mirror [Figure: 8.14].  Figure: 8.14 Physics

Physics 31 Representation of a vector : A vector quality is represented by an arrow over the symbol of the physical quantity. For Sometimes bold A instead of A is used to represent a vector and an ordinary A to represent its magnitude. The vector quantities in the table 2.1 are represented by bold letter. In figure, a vector quantity represented by an arrow headed straight line. The length of the straight line represents the magnitude and the arrow head indicates the direction of the vector. For example, in figure 2.2 displacement of 50km has been represented by 1cm. Hence the vector A in this figure, whose length is 3cm represents a displacement of 150km towards west. The vector B represents a displacement of 100km towards north at an angle of 300 with the east.

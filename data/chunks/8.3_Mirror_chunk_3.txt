a convex mirror. Center of curvature: The centre of the sphere of which the spherical mirror is a part is called the centre of curvature of that mirror. In figure 8.7, C is the centre of curvature. Radius of curvature: The radius of the sphere of which the spherical mirror is a part is called the radius of curvature of that mirror. In figure 8.7, PC or MC is the radius of curvature. Radius of curvature is denoted by r. Figure: 8.7 Principal axis: The straight line passing through the pole and the centre of curvature of a spherical mirror is called the principal axis of that mirror. In figure 8.7, PC is the principal axis. Secondary axis: The straight line passing through the centre of curvature and any point other than the pole on the reflecting surface of the sphere is called the secondary axis. In figure 8.7, Pâ€²C is the secondary axis. Physics  131 Principal focus: A beam of rays adjacent and parallel to the principal axis being incident on a spherical mirror converges at a point on the principal axis (in case of concave mirror) or appears to be diverging from a point on the principal axis (in case of convex mirror) after reflection, then this point is called the principal focus of the mirror.

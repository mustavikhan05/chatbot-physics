means the current is flowing through the coil. Now remove the magnet. Whatâ€™s happening? The deflection of galvanometer will be the opposite of that time when magnet was entered to the coil. If the magnet is kept stationary now, the galvanometer will show the deflections when the coil is moved towards or away from the magnet. If the coil is moved away from the magnet, we can see the deflection at the opposite side. Figure: 12.3 a Figure: 12.4 Physics 201 Experiment-2: For this experiment two closed coil made of insulated copper wire to be taken. A galvanometer is to be connected with the first coil. In the second coil, a battery, a rheostat and a tapping key are to be connected [12.5a]. The coil which is connected to the sources of emf is called the primary coil and which is connected to the galvanometer is called secondary coil. When the current is switched on in the primary coil, the deflection of galvanometer will be seen for a moment in the secondary coil [12.5b]. Again the deflection of galvanometer will be seen at the time of disconnecting the electric current but the deflection will be opposite to the direction of former. If the current is continuously varied in the primary coil, the galvanometer will show the deflections. In this case, the direction in which the galvanometer will deflect during rise of current is opposite to that during fall of current. Keeping the current fixed in the primary coil a variation of the distance between the two coils will produce a momentary deflection of the galvanometer. The direction of deflection due to increase of distance is opposite to that due to reduction in distance between the coils.  Figure: 12.5 a

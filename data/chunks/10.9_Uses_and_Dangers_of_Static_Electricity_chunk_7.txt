of the glass rod by a piece of silk cloth properly. 5. Bring the rubbed end of the glass rod near a freely suspended pith ball. 6. The glass rod attracts the pith ball towards it as the glass rod is charged due to friction. 7. The glass rod is charged positively. (You can prove that with the help of an electroscope) 8. Now bring the charged glass rod near to an end of an uncharged conductor. Fig: 10.18 Physics 173 9. Due to induction the uncharged conductor will be charged. The near end of the conductor will be negatively charged and the far end positively. 10. If the far end of the conductor is connected to earth by a wire or if touched barefooted without displacing the glass rod, electron from the ground will neutralize the positive charges of the conductor. As a result, only the negative charges will remain in the conductor. 11. Now if the conductor is brought near a pith ball it will be attracted. 12. The conductor is charged by the process of induction.

is called plane mirror. The mirror which we usually use is plane mirror. Spherical mirror If the reflecting surface is smooth and spherical, that means if the reflecting surface is a part of a sphere and regular reflection takes place on it, it is called spherical mirror. Spherical mirrors are shown in figures 8.5 and 8.6. If a part of a hollow glass sphere is cut off and silvering is done on one surface, then a spherical mirror is made. Again, spherical mirrors are of two types. These are: 1. Concave mirror 2. Convex mirror Concave mirror: If the concave surface of a sphere acts as the reflector, that is if regular reflection of light takes place from the concave surface of the spherical mirror, then it is called a concave mirror. In this case, concave mirror is made by silvering on the convex surface of the part of the sphere [figure 8.5]. The concave mirror is a 130  Physics converging mirror since the parallel beam of light converges at a point or meets together after reflection from its surface.  Figure: 8.5

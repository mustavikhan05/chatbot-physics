of the rod is L = y – x. With this scale length may be measured to an accuracy of 1 millimeter. For more accurate measurement vernier scales are used. Vernier scale : In the ordinary meter scale we can measured length up to 1 millimeter. To measure fractions of millimeter like 0.2mm, 0.6mm, 0.8mm etc. we have to use vernier scale. This scale was invented by a mathematician Pierea Vernier and is called vernier scale according to his name. Fig.1.1 Vernier Scale A small scale is used by the side of the main scale for accurate measurement of fractions of the smallest division of the main scale. By using vernier scale along with meter scale fractions of millimeter may be measured accurately. Vernier scale can be moved forward or backward along the side of the main scale. Say, a vernier scale has ten divisions, this ten division is equal to nine smallest divisions of the main scale (fig 1.1). Nine smallest divisions of main scale is 9 millimeter or 0.9 centimeter. As 10 vernier scale divisions is equal to nine smallest divisions of the main scale. So, a vernier scale division is slightly smaller than the smallest division of the main scale. The difference between the smallest main scale division and the vernier scale division is called vernier constant. It is generally written by VC. A simple equation may be used to determine the vernier constant, that is vernier constant = s/n, where s is the length of 1 smallest division of the main scale and n the number of vernier divisions. As mentioned above, s = 1 mm and n = 10 divisions ∴ Vernier constant = s / n = 1mm / 10 = 0.1mm = 0.01cm. Sometimes 20 vernier scale divisions are equal to 19 smallest main scale divisions and the smallest main scale division is less than 1mm. Then the vernier constant becomes difference. The vernier constant depends on the characteristics of marking the main scale and the vernier scale.

mechanical energy. Fan rotates and factory runs with the help of electric energy. Energy exists in the universe in different forms. Generally we observe the following forms of energy. Such as, mechanical energy, heat energy, sound energy, light energy, magnetic energy, electrical energy, chemical energy, nuclear energy and solar energy. The most common form of energy is mechanical energy. The energy that is stored in a body due to its position or motion is called mechanical energy. In this lesson we will discuss two forms of mechanical energy-kinetic energy is produced due to motion and potential energy is produced due to the position of object. Kinetic Energy: We sometimes notice that cricket ball hits the stamp and strikes it down. If anything hard hits the glass of window the glass breaks down. If we throw stones at mango or jujube it may fall down. From the above example we can see energy exists in the body in motion. The capacity of doing work acquired by a moving body due to its motion is called kinetic energy. Do it yourself: Keep a pen on a table or a desk in front of you. Put a light object before the pen. Hit the pen by your finger towards the object. Why does the object displace from its initial position? This is because the hit makes the pen move and the pen obtains the ability to work that is kinetic energy is produced in it. So it could displace the object. Creating velocity in a body in rest or increasing the velocity of a moving object means to produce acceleration in it. For this force has to be applied. As a result work will be done on the body. For this the body will obtain the ability to work and this work will be stored 72

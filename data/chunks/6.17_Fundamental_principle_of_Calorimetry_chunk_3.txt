The distance between two electric poles is 30m. A copper wire with a length of 30.01m was connected to those two pillars in a day when temperature was 30°C. Coefficient of linear expansion of copper is 1.67 10-6K-1. The wire tore in a winter day when the temperature of the air was 4°C. a) Define triple point of water. b) If two bodies have the equal amount of heat, yet can they be at different temperature? Explain. c) Express the temperature of air in Fahrenheit scale. d) Explain the cause for the wire to tear with mathematical logic. min 114  Physics Chapter seven WAVES AND SOUND

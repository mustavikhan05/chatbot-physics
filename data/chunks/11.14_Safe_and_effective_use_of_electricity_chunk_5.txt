earth through the metal casing. As a result, the fuse will blow out and cut off the electric supply to the appliance. It is strongly recommended to provide an earthing to the refrigerator in houses for safe use of it. Figure 11.17 demonstrates how a washing machine without earthing may be risky. How earth wire works as a safety precaution is demonstrated in figure 11.18. Figure 11.17 and 11.18 Live wire (L) Live wire (L) Neutral wire (N) Physics 195 Figure: 11.18 In addition, three-pin plugs are used in many portable devices. Fuses are connected in these plugs as safety measures. Fuse keeps the device safe. Investigation-11.1 To design an electric circuit suitable for home and demonstration of its uses. Objectives: The learners will design an electric circuit suitable for home and demonstrate the uses of AC source in different parts of it. Procedure: 1. Draw the live (L) and neutral (N) wire of the electric cable at the beginning. 2. Now connect this two wires to main fuse box, electricity meter and distribution box one after another. 3. Draw main switch in the distribution box. 4. Now draw two fuses in the distribution box. The fuses must be connected to the live (L) wire. 5. Connect two lamps and a fan with the fuse in parallel and complete the circuit. Draw switch on the L wire for each of the lamp and fan. 6. Give connection to different power sockets for television set, electric iron etc. using the other fuse. Do yourself:Draw poster to build consciousness about the dissipation and preservation of electrical energy. 1. Collect poster papers from shop to make poster. 2. Write on poster using different colour pen what necessary steps should be taken to protect dissipation and preservation of electrical energy. 3. The teacher will select the best poster and give award. 196  Physics Exercise A.  Multiple choice questions Tick (âˆš ) the correct answer. 1. What are the materials through which electric current can flow very easily?  a. insulator

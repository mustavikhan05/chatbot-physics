As for example, 6733000000 are 6.733 x 109 and 0.00000846 is 8.46 x 10-6. So it is seen that the original number is obtained from a number expressed in notation by placing the decimal point to the right by the number of digits equal to the power of 10 if the power is positive and to the left if the power is negative. In the case of numbers expressed in scientific notation the following general rule of multiplication is applicable : 10m x 10n = 10m+n Here, m and n may be any positive or negative number. For example, 106 x 107 = 1013, 107 x 10-20 = 10-13 In case of division the following rule is applicable : = 10n 10m = 10n ÷ 10m = 10n-m  For example, 106 ÷ 104 = 102 or 103 ÷ 10-7 = 10 3-(-7) = 1010

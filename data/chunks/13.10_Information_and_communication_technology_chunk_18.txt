Physics 227 Chapter fourteen PHYSICS TO SAVE LIFE [Establishing a relationship between physics with biology, a new subject has been developed, which is called Bio-physics. We need a healthy, strong and disease free body to survive. To keep a sound health we need proper treatment. In medical science, proper diagnosis is an important issue. Different types of medical instruments are prepared based on different theories and principles of physics. These devices function by utilizing different principles and theories of physics. A few of such instruments will be discussed in this chapter.] By the end of this chapter we will be able to- 1.  Explain the basis of bio-physics. 2.  Explain the contributions of Jagdish Chandra Bose in bio-physics. 3.  Explain that human body runs following the rules of physics. 4.  Explain the applications of ideas and theories of physics in the instruments for diagnosis of diseases in medical science. 5.  Explain the hazards of using modern technology and devices and mechanism of prevention. 6.  Conscious about the necessity of diagnosis of diseases for proper treatment and raise consciousness among others. 7.  Appreciate the contributions of science and technology for diagnosis of diseases. 228  Physics

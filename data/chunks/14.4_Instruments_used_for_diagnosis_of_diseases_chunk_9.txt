disease 234 Physics diagnosis method. X-ray or any other kind of radiation is not used in this machine. The signals received from the part of the body which is scanned with MRI are transformed using computers and a very distinct image of that part of the body is formed. Each individual image acts as a slice of the organ of the body. Thus a number of images are formed, which exhibits all the characteristics of that part of the body. Figure 14.5: MRI machine The image obtained by MRI can be compared to each individual slice of bread. When one slice of the bread is picked up, then the interior part of the bread can be seen along with the slice. Similarly, each image found by MRI helps to view everything inside the body. The intensity of the wound is determined using MRI in case of twisting of ankles and back pain. MRI is an extremely valuable test to form an extended image of brain and spinal cord. ECG ECG is the abbreviated form of the word electrocardiogram. ECG is a diagnostic procedure that is routinely used to assess the electrical and muscular functions of the heart. We know that the heart produces tiny electrical impulses without any external stimulation. This electrical signal spread through the heart muscle to make the heart contract. We detect these impulses by the ECG machine. With the help of ECG we can measure the rate and rhythms of heartbeats. It gives indirect evidence of blood flow in the heart. The electrodes placed on the different parts of the body detect the electrical impulses coming from different directions within the heart. To get a complete picture of the heart, twelve signals are identified using ten electrodes. An electrode lead is placed on each arm and leg i.e. total of four and rest six electrodes are placed across the chest wall [Figure 14.6]. The signals received from each electrode are recorded. The printed view of these recordings is the electro gram. Physics  235

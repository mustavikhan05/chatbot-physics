? a) Mass b) Heat c) Electric current d) Quantity of substance 4. When a rod is placed between the jaws of a slide calipers, the main scale reading is found 4 cm, vernier super-imposition is 7 and if the vernicer constant is 0.1mm, what is the length of the rod? a) 4.07 cm b) 4.7cm c) 4.07 mm d) 4.7 mm From the figure below answer the questions no. 5 and 6. Fig (a) Fig (b) 5. a) b) c)   d)   Physics  25 6. The ratio of volume of figure (a) and Fig (b):  a) 1:0.673  b) 1:0.0673  c) 1:0.763  d) 1:0.637 B. Creative question: Rashed said that the length of his pencil is 11.73 cm measured by his newly purchased scale. His friend Sujon said that this measurement may not correct too. Rashed said that he obtained the same result measuring by the scale several times. When they went to the teacher, he instructs them to use a vernier scale of constant 0.005 cm. Rashed measured the correct length by the vernier scale. a) What is vernier constant ? b) Why unit is required to express the amount of a quantity? c) Find how many divisions of vernier scale is equal to what number of divisions of main scale. d) First measurement of length measured by Rashed was irrelevant to accurate measurement, explain with logic. C. General questions : 1.  Write a report on why we should study physics. 2.  Wonderful advancement took place in the twentieth century- put logic with example in favour of this. 3.  a) What do you mean by quantity ? b) Write down the difference between fundamental and derived quantities. 4.  a) In SI unit which quantities are considered as fundamental quantities ? b) Write down the name of units of these quantities. 5.  What do you mean by dimension?   26  Physics Chapter Two MOTION

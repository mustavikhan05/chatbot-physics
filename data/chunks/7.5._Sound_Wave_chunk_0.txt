We know that the sound is a power. This power is circulated through wave. Sound wave is a longitudinal wave. During the circulation of this wave, the detraction and expansion of the substance are created (Fig 7.9).This sound wave makes a sense of hearing in our ear by being circulated from the medium. It is noticeable that the sound is not created without vibration. When tune-pin copper, bowl, the bell of school is ringing, you will understand that they are vibrating if you touch them. When you speak, you will see that your throat is vibrating. Here, Wave-length, λ=20cm=0.2m Sound-velocity=340ms-1 Frequency, ƒ =? Period (time), T=? Figure: 7.9 Physics

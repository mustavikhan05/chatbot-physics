primary coil, the galvanometer will show the deflections. In this case, the direction in which the galvanometer will deflect during rise of current is opposite to that during fall of current. Keeping the current fixed in the primary coil a variation of the distance between the two coils will produce a momentary deflection of the galvanometer. The direction of deflection due to increase of distance is opposite to that due to reduction in distance between the coils. Figure: 12.5 a Figure: 12.5 b

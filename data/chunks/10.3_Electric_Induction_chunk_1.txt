free electrons of the conductor are attracted by the positive charges of the glass rod and move the end A. Therefore, the end B falls in short of electrons and is charged positively. The end A is charged negatively. With a charge collector [a small metal sheet attached to a nonconductor handle] if some charges are collected from end B and their nature is detected with the help of an electroscope then the above discussion will be proved. Physics 163 Here no new charge is produced. Due to the presence of the charges glass rod equal amount of opposite charges are separated only and move towards the end o the conductor. As long as the glass rod is present near the conductor AB, the opposite charges are separated and remain at the end of the conductor. In the above experiment the positive charges in the glass rod which has created induction in the conductor AB is called inducing charge. The charges which are accumulated in the conductor A are called induced charge. Extended activities: Rub a balloon full of air with your shirt. Then press the balloon with the wall of your house for a while and then release it. What did you observe? The balloon becomes attached to the wall. Extended activities: Rub a plastic object with your shirt. Then hold it near a narrow flow of water falling from a tap. The flow of water will bend towards the plastic object.  The negative charge of the balloon produces electrostatic induction in the wall. The induced positive charge in the wall attracts the negatively charged balloon [Fig: 10.5]. Same case occurs with the narrow flow of tap water [Fig 10.6].

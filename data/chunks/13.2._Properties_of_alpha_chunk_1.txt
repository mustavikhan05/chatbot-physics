is 3.2×10-19 C. Its presence can be detected by photographic films, cloud chamber and gold leaf electroscope. These particles create florescence on zinc sulphide screen. The velocity of it is 10% of the velocity of light. Beta particle: These particles are negatively charged and largely deflected by magnetic and electric field. The speed of it is 50% of the speed of light but it can be increased up to 98%. Its mass is the same as that of electron i.e. 9.11×10-31kg. Its existence can be detected by photographic film and cloud chamber. These particles can produce fluorescence. Their penetrating power is more than that of the Alpha particles. The motion of these particles can be stopped by a 3mm thick aluminum sheet. Beta particles can produce enough ionization in a gas. Gamma rays: These rays are charge neutral. This is an electromagnetic wave. It is of short wavelength. It has no mass. It is not deflected by electric and magnetic field. Its speed is same to that of light, which means 3×108 ms-1. Its penetrating power is very high. It can pass through a lead sheet having a few centimeter thickness. Though its ionizing power is less, it can produce fluorescence. Its presence can be identified by photographic film, cloud chamber and Geiger–Müller counter. Physics  211

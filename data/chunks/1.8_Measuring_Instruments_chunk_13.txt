scale. Thus the mass of an object is determined with the help of known weights. Stopwatch Stopwatch is used to measure small time interval. Stopwatches are of two kinds digital stopwatch and analog stopwatch. Digital stopwatch can give more accurate reading than that of analog stopwatch. A analog stopwatch can give an accurate reading up to ± 0.15 while a digital stopwatch can read accurately up to ±0.015. Now a days digital stopwatch is found in mobile phone also. Physics 19 A stopwatch has to start and stop by the hands to measure a time. An error of about a large fraction of a second takes place in the reading of time interval though it may vary from person to person. The degree of error is more to the old than the young. For most of the people the error is about 0.3seconds.

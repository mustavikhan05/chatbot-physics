is, generally we see these moving body- car, cycle, rickshaw, etc are the example of non-uniform acceleration. Mathematical Example 2.1 : Velocity of a car increases uniformly at the rate of 5ms-1 and after 10s becomes 45ms-1 . Find the acceleration of the car. Solution : Here, We know, initial velocity u = 5ms-1 a = v – u final velocity v = 45ms-1 t time t = 5s or, a = 45ms-1 – 5ms-1 ∴acceleration a = ? 5s = 40ms-1      5s      = 8ms-2      Ans : 8ms-2      × Physics  37 Mathematical Example 2.2 : The Velocity of a car decreases uniformly from 20ms-1 and after 4s it becomes 4ms-1 . Find the acceleration of the car.  Solution : Here,  We know, initial velocity u = 20ms-1  a = v – u    final velocity  v  = 4ms-1 t    time t  = 4s  or, a =  4ms-1 – 20ms-1  ∴acceleration a  = ? 4s      = -16ms-1      = 45      = - 4ms-2      Ans : - 4ms-2

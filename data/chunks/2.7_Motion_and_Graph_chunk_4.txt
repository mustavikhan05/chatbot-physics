of finding acceleration from velocity-time graph in case uniform acceleration is discussed below. In case of uniform acceleration : When a body moves with uniform acceleration, its velocity increases equally for equal intervals of time. Hence the velocity-time graph will be a straight line (fig 2.7). Now let us take a point P on this graph and draw a normal PM on the X-axis from P. Then the change of velocity PM for any time interval of OM is obtained. 44  Physics âˆ´ Acceleration, a =  change of velocity time interval = PM OM But,  PM OM  is the slope or gradient of OP So it is said that the slope of tangent drawn at any point on velocity-time graph represents the acceleration of that point. Do by yourself : The velocity of a car after every five seconds is given in the table below. Table : 2.4 Time (s) Velocity (kmh-1) Velocity (ms-1) 0 0 0 5 9 2.5 10 18 5.0 15 27 7.5 20 36 10.0 25 45 12.5 30 54 15.0 Take a graph paper. Draw the velocity-time graph on the graph paper using any convenient unit mentioned in the table above. Find the velocity and acceleration of the car in 12 seconds from the graph. Investigation: 2.1 Determination of the average speed of a marble rolling over slanting plank. Objective : To determine the average speed in every case finding time of equal distance traveled in different acceleration. Apparatus : Plank, meter scale, marble, stopwatch. Working Procedure : 1.  Take a plank long as possible 2.  Place brick or book under one end to make it high. So the plank will be inclined with the horizontal 3.  Hold a marble at the upper end of the plank and then start the stopwatch the moment you release the marble. Stop the stopwatch the moment it strikes the ground 4.  Find the average speed dividing the distance i.e. the length of the plank the marble travels by this time 5.

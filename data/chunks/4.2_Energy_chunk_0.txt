Nothing can move or work without energy. We need energy for our survival. The amount of work we do everyday depends on our energy level. We get energy from the food we take. Plants need energy for growth. Engine also needs energy for its functioning. Some engines use electricity and some need fuel for energy. Energy is stored in fuel. What do we mean by energy? The energy of a body means its ability to work. So the body which is able to work has energy in it and the body that does not have energy in it cannot work. displacement ( time )2 (displacement)2 ( time )2 ML2 T2 Given, Mass of man, m = 70kg Force, F = weight of the man = mg = 70kg Ã— 9.8 ms-2 = 686N Displacement, S = 200m Work, W =?

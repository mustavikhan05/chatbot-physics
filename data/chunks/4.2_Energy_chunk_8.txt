support and a block to its other end. Place them on a smooth surface. Now apply force on the block and contract the spring and keep another object in front of the block [Fig: 4.4] then remove your hand. Why did the object move fast? Spring could work while regaining its original configuration and was able to displace the other body. This ability of spring to work for the change of its normal configuration is its potential energy. If some work is done against the force at the time of changing from normal position or configuration to some other position or configuration then the body obtains the capacity of doing work that is same amount of energy is stored in it. This principle is applicable within the sphere of influence of conservative force such as electric force, magnetic force, spring force etc. This sphere of influence is called the field of that force such as gravitational field, electric field etc. We work against the force of gravity when we lift anything higher from the ground. As a result the object obtains some amount of potential energy. It can perform the same amount of work when it falls on the ground. If a body of mass m is raised to a height h (fig:4.5) above the surface of the earth, the work done in such a process is a measure of potential energy stored in the body.

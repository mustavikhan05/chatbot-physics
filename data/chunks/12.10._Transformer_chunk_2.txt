flows in this coil. This curent by magnetising the core produces magnetic lines of foorce that ultimately produces induced emf in the primary coil. If there is no diminution of the magnctic lines same number of magnetic lines remain associated with each turn of the sccondary coil. Consequently an emf is induced in the secondary coil. If the number of turns in the secondary coil be ns and the induced emf be Es, We have: Ep Es = np ns 12.1 That is to say that the induced emf in the coil is proportional to the number of turns. For a step up transformer ns > np and for a step down transformer ns < np. If no energy is dissipated in the transformer core, the energy input to the primary coil is wholly transferred to the secondary coil. Therefore, voltage of the primary coil x current of primary coil = Voltage of secondary coil x current of secondary coil i.c. Ep Ip = Es Is Therefore, Ep Es = Is Ip

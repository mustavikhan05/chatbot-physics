the two terminals of the bulb. Therefore, the potential difference between the two points of a circuit is defined as the amount of electrical energy converted to other forms of energy (e.g. - heat, light) when unit positive charge migrates between the two points. If W is the amount of electrical energy converted to other forms for migration of Q amount of charge, then the potential difference between the two points is Fig. 11.6 182 Physics W V Q = The SI unit for potential difference is the same as that for electromotive force. That is volt (V). The potential difference between the two points will be 1 V if 1 J of electrical energy is converted to other forms when 1C positive charge flows between the two points. Experiment:Measure the potential difference between the two terminals of a dry cell. This is the electromotive force. Now connect this cell to the bulb and again measure the potential difference between the two terminals of the cell. The voltmeter reading is the potential difference between the two ends of the bulb or of resistance during the current flow. Now compare the values of the measured electromotive force and potential difference. You will observe that the value of E is larger than that of V.

(2.2) ∴ s = ut + 1 2 at2 (2.3) ∴ v2 = u2 + 2as (2.4) If it is said in a problem the body starts its motion from rest, the initial velocity will be u = 0 Mathematical Example 2.3 : A car starting from rest moves with acceleration of 2ms-2 its velocity reach at 20ms-1 . How long time does the car take part in acceleration activity? Solution :  Here,  We know, initial velocity u = 0  v =  u + at    final velocity  v  = 20ms-1    acceleration a = 2ms-2 or, at = v – u  ∴ time  = ?  t = v – u      a       =  20ms-1 - 0      2ms-2

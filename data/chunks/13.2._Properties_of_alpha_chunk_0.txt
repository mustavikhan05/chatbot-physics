Alpha particle: Alpha particle is a Helium nucleus. There are two protons and two neutrons in its nucleus. The penetrating power of alpha particle is less; it cannot pass through 6 cm thick air. These particles are influenced by both the magnetic and electric field. These particles can create intense ionization and are very harmful and dangerous. The mass of this particle is four times than that of the Hydrogen atom and its charge is 3.2Ã—10-19 C. Its presence can be detected by photographic films, cloud chamber and gold leaf electroscope. These particles create florescence on zinc sulphide screen. The velocity of it is 10% of the velocity of light. Beta particle: These particles are negatively charged and largely deflected by magnetic and electric field. The speed of it is 50% of the speed of light but it can be increased up to 98%. Its mass is the same as that of electron i.e.

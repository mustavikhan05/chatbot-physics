and acceleration a is replaced by accelerate on due to gravity g then the equations of falling body will be as following. v = u+gt h = (u+v)t 2 h = ut + 1 2 gt2 v2 = u2 + 2gh Mathematical Example : 2.6 : A body drops from the roof of a building 50m high. With what velocity will it strike the ground. g = 9.8ms-2 We know, in case of falling bodies v2 = u2 + 2gh or v2 = 0 + 2 x 9.8 ms-2 x 50m  = 980m2s-2   âˆ´ v = 31.3ms-1   Ans : 31.3ms-1

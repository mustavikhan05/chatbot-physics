of gravity when we lift anything higher from the ground. As a result the object obtains some amount of potential energy. It can perform the same amount of work when it falls on the ground. If a body of mass m is raised to a height h (fig:4.5) above the surface of the earth, the work done in such a process is a measure of potential energy stored in the body. In this Fig: 4.3 Fig: 4.4 Fig: 4.5 74 Physics case, the work done is the product of the applied gravitational force i.e. the weight of the body and the vertical height. ∴ Potential energy = weight of the body × vertical height

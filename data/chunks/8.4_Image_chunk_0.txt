When you look at a mirror, you see your image. It is not only in the case of mirrors, when you walk by the side of a pond or a river, your image appears in water that time also. This reflection is your image. When light is reflected in a mirror from your body or an object and comes to your eyes we see the image at that time. When light reflected from an object comes directly to our eyes, we see the object then. Again, if light does not enter our eyes directly rather it comes to our eyes being reflected or refracted in another medium, then also we see the object. Then it seems that the object is not in its actual position. When you see your image in a mirror, then it appears to you that you are behind the mirror. Actually you are in front of the mirror. The reflection of an object seen at the new position due to the presence of the mirror is called the image of that object.  Figure 8.10 132  Physics In figure 8.10, O is a point object in front of a concave mirror. The ray OM from the point O being parallel to the principal axis incident on the mirror and reflected through the principal focus along the line MFI. The ray OP incident on the pole P reflects along the path PI. The reflected rays intersects at the point I. The point I is the image of the point O.

and m2 are moving with velocities u1 and u2 respectively along a straight line. If the velocity of A is greater than that of B, at any time the object A will collide with the object B [Figure 3.7]. The force exerted on B by A is the action F1. The object B will also exert a force F2 on A, this F2 is the reaction force. According to Newton’s third law of motion, 1 2 F F = − Figure: 3.7 Physics  59 During collision, the action and reaction force exists for the same time. Let the time duration of action and reaction be t. After the collision the two objects will continue to move along the same straight line with their changed velocities. Let v1 and v2 be the changed velocities of A and B respectively. If due to action and reaction, the accelerations of A and B are a1 and a2 respectively, then 1 2 F F = −  or, 1 1 2 2 m a m a = −  or, 1 1 2 2 1 2 v u v u m m t t − − = −  or, 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 m v m u m v m u − = − +  or, 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 m u m u m v m v + = +  Therefore, the sum of the momentum of the objects A and B remains same before and after the collision. It is the law of conservation of momentum. Mathematical Example 3.3: A force of 2000 N acts on a body of mass 20 kg for a time of 0.1 s. What is the change of momentum of the body? Solution: We know,  change of momentum = force × time Here, mv mu Ft − =

force other than the gravitational force will act on the body. For example, the resistance due to air will not act on it. Laws of falling bodies are : First Law : All bodies falling from rest and from the same height without any resistance traverse equal distance in equal time. Second Law : The velocity (v), acquired by a freely falling body from rest in a given time (t) is directly proportional to time that is, v ∝ t Physics  41 Third Law : The distance (h) traversed by a freely falling body from rest in a given time (t) is directly proportional to the square of the time, that is, h ∝ t2. Equation of falling Body : Let a body be falling freely due to gravity with initial velocity u. The body attains a velocity v after time t. If the body falls through a distance h in that time and distance s is replaced by h and acceleration a is replaced by accelerate on due to gravity g then the equations of falling body will be as following. v = u+gt h = (u+v)t 2  h = ut + 1 2 gt2 v2 = u2 + 2gh Mathematical Example : 2.6 : A body drops from the roof of a building 50m high. With what velocity will it strike the ground. g = 9.8ms-2 We know, in case of falling bodies v2 = u2 + 2gh

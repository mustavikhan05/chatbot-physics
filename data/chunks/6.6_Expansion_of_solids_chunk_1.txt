of the material of the solid. Its unit is K-1. The coefficient of linear expansion of copper is 16.7 × 10-6 K-1 means if the temperature of copper rod is raised through 1K, then its length increases by 16.7 × 10-6 m. Mathematical example 6.2: The length of a steel rod is 100m at 20°C. If its length becomes 100.033m at 50°C, then determine the coefficient of linear expansion of steel. We know, Coefficient of linear expansion, α = = = 11 10-6 K-1  Observation: Why a gap is kept at the joining point of two rails of a rail line? The rails expand due to heat of the sun or due to heat produced by friction between the wheels and rails while the train runs. For this expansion sufficient space is kept between the two rails. If gaps between the rails are not kept, the rail line will bend due to its expansion. Superficial expansion and coefficient of superficial expansion: The area of a solid  is increased with the increase of temperature. It is called superficial expansion. Let initial surface area of a solid at θ1 temperature = A1 When the temperature is increased to θ2 the final surface area = A2 Increase in temperature = θ2 - θ1 And increase in area = A2 – A1 The coefficient of superficial expansion is expressed by the symbol β ∴ Superficial expansion, β =

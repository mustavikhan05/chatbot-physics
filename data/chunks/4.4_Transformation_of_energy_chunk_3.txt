or radio converts electrical energy into sound energy. In a storage cell electric energy is converted into chemical energy. In electromagnets electric energy is converted into magnetic energy. 6. Transformation of Nuclear energy: In nuclear submarine nuclear energy is transformed into mechanical energy. Devastating action of atom bomb is nothing but the transformation of nuclear energy. Nowadays, transformation of nuclear energy into other forms of energy especially electrical energy in a nuclear reactor mostly satisfies the demand of energy. Physics 81 We can understand from the electric power station that the way energy is transformed from one form to another and we get light and heat energy in our houses. By burning coal and natural gas in a power station, we can obtain chemical and heat energy. Heat energy is converted into mechanical energy with the help of turbine which rotates the coil of electric generator. In this process electrical energy is produced. Electric bulb and heater of houses and factories transform electrical into light and heat energy. Again, which energy is transformed into what type of energy when we pierce a nail into wood by hammering it? The chemical energy of our boy is used to lift the hammer upward which is stored as potential energy due to the higher position of it. When it moves down the potential energy stored is transformed into kinetic energy. This kinetic energy is used to pierce the nail into wood. At the same time sound energy and heat energy in nail, wood and in hammer is produced. During the transformation energy may not be created or destroyed but reduced. Such as, we cannot make use of all the heat energy as we can use light or electric energy.

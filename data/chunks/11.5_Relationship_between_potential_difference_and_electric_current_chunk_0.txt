We know, if there is a potential difference between the two terminals of a conductor, current flows through it. The quantity of this electric current depends on the potential difference between the two ends of the conductor, the conductor itself and the temperature of it. George Simon Ohm has discovered the law regarding the relationship between the electric current that flows in a conductor and the potential difference between the two terminals of it- which is known as Ohm’s law. Ohm’s law The current passing through a conductor at constant temperature is directly proportional to the potential difference between the two ends of the conductor. By proportionality it means- if the potential difference between the two ends is doubled, the current flowing through the conductor will be doubled.  Again, if the potential difference between the two terminals is made one third, the current passing through the conductor will be one third. Assume AB is a conducting wire. The potential of its two terminals are VA and VB [Figure 11.3] respectively. If VA > VB, The potential difference between the two terminals of the conductor will be V = VA - VB.  Figure: 11.3 Now at constant temperature, if the current passing through the conductor is I, then according to ohm’s law, I ∝ V ⇒ V R I = = constant This constant is called the resistance of the conductor at that temperature. or, V I R =  Graph of V-I is shown in fig. 11.4 Fig: 11.14 180  Physics Mathematical Example11.1: A current of 4 A is flowing through the filament of the headlight of a motor car. If the potential difference between the two ends of the filament is 12 V, what is the resistance of it?

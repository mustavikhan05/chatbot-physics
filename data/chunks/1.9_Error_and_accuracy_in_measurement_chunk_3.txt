a substance is the surface of that substance. And the substance occupy some space is called volume of the substance if area of a substance is A and volume of the substance V. A = L x B, where L = Length of the substance ....................... (i) B = Breadth of the substance and V = L x B x H where, L = Length of the substance............ (ii) B = Breadth of the substance H = Height of the substance For taking the reading of any length by slide calipers. Length = Main scale reading (M) + Vernier super imposition (V) x vernier constant (VC) that is, L or B or H = M + V x VC Apparatus : Slide calipers, Rectangular substance Procedure : 1)

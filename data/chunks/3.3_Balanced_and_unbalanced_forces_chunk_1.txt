of the rope. In this competition equal numbers of competitors pull on the rope in two sides and try to move the handkerchief to their side. If the handkerchief does not move then it is understood that either the team are applying equal amount of force and the rope or the handkerchief is in balanced condition. Here, forces applied by the two teams are balanced forces. If one team applies more force than the other, then the resultant force will act along them thus creating unbalanced force and the handkerchief will move to their side. Then this team will be declared as the winning team in the competition.

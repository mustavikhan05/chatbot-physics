Special properties of matter are used to measure the temperature. Some physical properties of substances change uniformly with the change of temperature. Using that physical property of substance temperature can be measured easily and accurately and it is called the thermometric property of that substance. Thermometric substances are used in thermometers. Thermometric properties of substances are â€“ volume, resistance and pressure etc. In mercury thermometer the mercury in the capillary glass tube is called thermometric substance and the length of the mercury column is called thermometric property. Similarly in the case of gas thermometer the gas kept in the container at a constant volume is termed as thermometric substance and the pressure of the gas is called thermometric property.

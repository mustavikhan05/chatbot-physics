temperature was 30°C. Coefficient of linear expansion of copper is 1.67 10-6K-1. The wire tore in a winter day when the temperature of the air was 4°C. a) Define triple point of water. b) If two bodies have the equal amount of heat, yet can they be at different temperature? Explain. c) Express the temperature of air in Fahrenheit scale. d) Explain the cause for the wire to tear with mathematical logic. min 114 Physics Chapter seven WAVES AND SOUND [If we throw a stone into pond water, we see the wave. Wave carries energy from one place to another. Sound is a kind of wave. The sound energy can create the sensation of hearing. We can send information using sound. So the sound is closely related to our life. But sound pollution causes much harm to us. We shall discuss wave, sound, echo of sound, velocity of sound, sound pollution etc. in this chapter.]  By the end of this chapter, we will be able to- 1. Explain the characteristics of waves. 2. Set and measure the simple mathematical relation among the quantities related to wave. 3. Explain the characteristics of sound waves. 4. Explain the creation of echo. 5. Explain the uses of echo in our daily life. 6. Set up the mathematical relation among the velocity of sound, frequency and wave length and measure the quantities from it. 7. Explain the change of the velocity of sound. 8. Explain the range of hearing and its uses. 9. Explain the pitch and intensity of sound. 10. Explain the reasons and consequences of sound pollution and the techniques to prevent it. Physics  115

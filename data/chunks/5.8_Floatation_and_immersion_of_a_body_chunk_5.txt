cylinders are filled up with a liquid. Now a force F applied to the smaller piston generates a pressure F1/A1. According to Pascal’s law this pressure is transmitted in all directions through the liquid. Therefore the upward pressure exerted on the larger piston is F1/A1. Because of this pressure, the larger piston experiences an upward force equal to (F1/A1) × A2. If the upward force of larger piston is F2, then F2 =

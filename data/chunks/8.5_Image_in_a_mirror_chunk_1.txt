the reflected rays are coming from the point I situated behind the mirror. Therefore, the point I is the virtual image of the point O. Figure: 8.12 The normal QN is drawn at the point Q. Since TO and QN are parallel, OQ is the interjector. ∴∠TOQ = ∠OQN = i (8.1) Again, OI and QN are parallel, line RQI has intersected them. ∴∠TIQ = ∠NQR = r (8.2) We know, i = r We get from equations (8.1) and (8.2), ∠TOQ = ∠TIQ Now between ∆QOT and ∆QIT, ∠ TOQ = ∠TIQ, TQ is a common arm, and ∠QTO = ∠QTI = 90° Therefore, the triangles are equal in all respects. Hence, OT = TI The image I in a plane mirror is at the same distance behind the mirror as the object O is in front. (B) Extended object The image of an extended object can also be drawn as the point object. In this case, the extended object should be considered as an aggregation of infinite number of points. Here, a virtual image is formed for each point behind the mirror [Figure 8.13]. 134  Physics

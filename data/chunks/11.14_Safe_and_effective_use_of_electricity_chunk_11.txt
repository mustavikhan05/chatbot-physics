filament of the headlight of a motor car. If the potential difference between the two ends of the filament is 12 V, what is the resistance? 11. The electromotive force of a dry cell is 1.5 V. What is the energy spent by the cell in driving 0.5 C of charge round the circuit. 12. What are fixed and variable resistors? 13. What do you understand by electromotive force and potential difference? 198 Physics Chapter twelve MAGNETIC EFFECT OF CURRENT [As the current has magnetic effect, the magnet has the electric effect also. Many electric tools have been made by using these two effects. These tools have solved many problems of us, have brought out various comforts and have developed the standard of our life. In this chapter, we shall discus about the functions and uses of electromagnet, electromagnetic induction, induced current and induced electric power, electric motor, generator, transformer etc.]  By the end of this chapter we will be able to - 1) Explain magnetic effect of electric current 2) Explain electromagnetic induction. 3) Explain induced current and induced electric power 4) Explain the main principles of motor and generator. 5) Explain the main principles of transformer. 6) Explain the functions of step-up and step-down transformer. 7)  Praise the various uses and contributions of current in our life.

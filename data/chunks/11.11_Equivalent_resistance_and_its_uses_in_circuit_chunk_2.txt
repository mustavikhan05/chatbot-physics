included in the combination. The value of the equivalent resistance in series combination is greater than that of individual resistances. Parallel combination of resistances When several resistances are connected in such a way that one terminal of all the resistances are joined at a common point A and the other terminals are joined at another common point B and potential difference across each of the resistors remains the same, then this combination of resistances are called parallel combination of resistances. Fig. 11.12 Three resistors R1, R2 and R3 are connected in a parallel combination. In this case, same potential difference V is maintained across the two terminals of the three resistors. Different amount of current is flowing through each of the resistors owing to their different values. The main current I of the circuit splits into three parts at the junction a and later recombine at the point b. Let I1, I2 and I3 are the currents flowing through the resistances R1, R2 and R3 respectively. Therefore, sum of the currents I1, I2 and I3 of parallel paths is equal to the current I at the junction a. Therefore, I = I1 + I2 + I3

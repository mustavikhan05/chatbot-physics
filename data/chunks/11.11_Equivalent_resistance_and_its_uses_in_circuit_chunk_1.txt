V IR = The potential difference across resistance R2, 2 2 V IR = The potential difference across resistance R3, 3 3 V IR = If V is the potential difference between the two terminals of all the resistors, i.e. the potential difference across the combination, âˆ´ 1 2 3 V V V V = + + = 1 2 3 IR IR IR + + Physics 187 1 2 3 ( ) I R R R = + + (11.5) Now if three resistances R1, R2 and R3 are replaced by a single resistance RS , so that same current I flows through the circuit and the potential difference V across them remains unchanged, then RS is the equivalent resistance of the combination. In case of equivalent resistance,  V = IRs (11.6) Comparing equations we get,  S IR 1 2 3 ( ) I R R R = + +  1 2 3 S R R R R = + +  If instead of three resistances, n number of resistances are connected in series then equivalent resistance sR  will be 1 2 3 ... S n R R R R R = + + + +  Therefore, the equivalent resistance of resistors connected is series is equal to the sum of the different resistances included in the combination. The value of the equivalent resistance in series combination is greater than that of individual resistances.  Parallel combination of resistances When several resistances are connected in such a way that one terminal of all the resistances are joined at a common point A and the other terminals are joined at another common point B and potential difference across each of the resistors remains the same, then this combination of resistances are called parallel combination of resistances.

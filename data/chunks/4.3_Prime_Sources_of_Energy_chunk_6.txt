different forms of energy in the water current Physics 77 such as, kinetic and potential energy. Electricity produced by means of water current is known as hydroelectricity. Different countries of the world make use of potential energy for producing electricity in hydroelectric projects. The method of producing hydroelectricity using the water current is simple. The current of water is used to rotate a turbine. A co-ordination of mechanical and magnetic energy is possible from the rotation of turbines. Electricity produced by mechanical energy created by water current in co-ordination of magnetic energy is called hydroelectricity. Making a model: Make a model of a hydroelectric station that uses the energy of falling water to turn a turbine to operate a dynamo to produce hydroelectricity. [Fig: 4.6]

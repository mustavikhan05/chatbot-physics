the weight of the body in completely submersed condition. Now find out the apparent loss of weight by subtracting the weight of the body immersed in water from the known weight of the body in air. Now determine the weight of the spilled out water. It will be observed that the apparent loss of weight of the body is equal to the weight of the displaced liquid. Thus we may have a proof of Archimedesâ€™ principle in a simple way. Calculate: The surface area of the bottom of a rectangular block is 25cm2. It is dipped in water. Density of water is 1000kgm-3. The depth of the upper surface of the block from the open surface of the water is 5cm. If the height of the block is 2cm, then 1. Find the water pressure P1 on the upper surface of the block 2. Calculate the pressure P2 at the bottom of the block 3. How much force will be applied by water on the upper surface of the block? 4. How much force will be applied by water at the bottom of the block? Make comments on the results.  Figur: 5.8 Figur: 5.9 Physics  95

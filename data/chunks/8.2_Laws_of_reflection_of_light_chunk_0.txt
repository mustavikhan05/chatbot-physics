We see many kinds of objects around us. Some of them give off light all around and some are not. The objects (such as- sun, star, lighted candle etc.) emit light of their own are called luminous objects. Conversely, objects (such as men, trees, table, wall, picture, chalk board etc.) that have no light of their own or do not emit light are called non- luminous objects. When light comes from the luminous object to our eyes we see the object. The common objects which we see around us are not luminous; in spite of this we can see them. The reason behind it is the reflection of light. Figure 8.1 shows how we can see a luminous (sun) and a non-luminous (cat) object. Eye sees the luminous object because light enters the eye directly from it. The light coming from the luminous object reflected by the cat enters our eyes and so we can see the cat.  Figure 8.1 128  Physics In a homogenous transparent medium (e.g.- glass) light travels in straight line with the same velocity. But when light travelling through the first medium falls on the surface of a second medium, then a portion of the light returns back to the first medium from the surface of separation of two medium. This phenomenon is called reflection of light. Laws of reflection: The incident and reflected ray obey two simple laws: 1. First law: The incident ray, reflected ray and the normal at the point of incidence on the reflector lie in the same plane. 2. Second law: The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.

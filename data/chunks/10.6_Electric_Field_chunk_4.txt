For the simplicity of description the conductors are taken as spherical. 1. For an isolated positive charge the nature of lines of force is shown in figure 10.11(a). In this case the lines of force emerged uniformly from the surface of the conductor perpendicularly. If the charge of the body increases then the number of lines of force also increases. 2. The lines of force of an electric field produced by two equal and opposite charges are shown in figure 10.11(b). In this case the line of force emerges from positive charge and terminates at negative charge. 3. The lines of force of an electric field produced by two equal positive charges placed nearby are shown in figure 10.11(c). In this case the lines of force go far away from each other; as a result there will be no lines of force in between them. F q Here, Charge, q= 5C Force, F= 200N Electric intensity, E= ? 200N 5C Figure: 10.11 Physics  167 In figure this place is indicated by ‘X’ sign. If a charge is placed at this place it will experience no force. This point is called neutral force. 4.  The lines of force of an electric field produced by two unequal positive charges placed nearby are shown in figure 10.11(d). In this case, the neutral point ‘N’ would not be nearer to the smaller charges.

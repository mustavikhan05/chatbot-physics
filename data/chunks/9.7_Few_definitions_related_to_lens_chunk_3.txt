principal axis after refraction passes through the principal focus (in the case of a convex lens) [9.15 (C) ] or appear to diverge from the principal focus (in the case of a concave lens) [9.15 (D)]. 3. A ray of light incidents through the principal focus (in the case of a convex lens) [9.15 (E)] or directed towards the principal focus (in the case of concave lens) [9.15 (F)] after refraction through the lens becomes parallel to the principal axis. Figure: 9.15 Physics  151 Image of an extended object Convex Lens: Suppose LOL1 is a convex lens. FOFâ€² is its principal axis, O is its optical centre and F is its principal focus. An extended object PQ is placed perpendicularly on the principal axis in front of the lens at a point between f and 2f. The image of the object PQ is to be drawn. A ray of light PR coming from P parallel to the principal axis incidents at R and is refracted through the principal focus F along the path RFP1. Another ray PO from P passes through the optical centre O and is refracted along the path OP1. The refracted rays RFP1 and OP1 meet at point P1. So, P1 is the real image of point P. From point P1 a perpendicular P1Q1 is drawn on the principal axis. So, P1Q1 is the real image of PQ. Here OQ is the distance of object and OQ1 is the distance of image [figure 9.16].

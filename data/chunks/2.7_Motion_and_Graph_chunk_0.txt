1. Distance-Time Graph : A moving object changes its position with the change of time. The distance traveled by the body depends on time. This relation can be represented graphically. In this case axis `X’ in the graph represents time (t) and axis Y represent distance (s). This graph is called distance-time graph. We can find velocity easily by this graph. The methods of determining velocity from the distance-time graph for uniform and non-uniform velocities are discussed below. We will discuss the motion of an object moving only along straight line to avoid the complexities. So the velocity changes only for its magnitude. (A) In case of uniform Velocity: Suppose a pollution free CNG run auto-rickshaw is moving along plane straight road. The table below shows the distances traveled after every 12 minutes. 42  Physics  Distance – Time table Time, t (min) Distance s km 0 0 12 6 24 12 36 18 48 24 60 30 Table 2.3

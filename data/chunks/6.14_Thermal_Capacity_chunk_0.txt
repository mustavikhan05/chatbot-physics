The amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a body through 1K is called the heat capacity of that body. The heat capacity depends on the material and the mass of the body. Its unit is JK-1. The heat capacity of a body is 10JK-1 means 10J heat is required to raise the temperature of the body through 1K. Let, Q amount heat is required to increase the temperature of a body through ∆θ. Therefore the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of the body through 1K is           . ∴ Heat capacity, C =              … … … (6.6)

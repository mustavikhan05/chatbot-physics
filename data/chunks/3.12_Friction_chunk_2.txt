body Objective: To measure force by simple experiment Formula: We know, if a force F acts on a body of mass m and the resulting acceleration due to the force is a, then F=ma. The acceleration a of the body can be expressed by g in case of force due to gravity. That is, the force of gravity or weight of the body, W mg = . We shall measure weight of a body as an example of force. 66 Physics Instruments: Spring balance, a body. Working procedure: 1. Hang a spring balance from wall calibrated in Newton. 2. Now, hang the body from the hook under the spring balance. 3. Record the reading of the weight or force of gravity from scale and note it down in the table. 4. Repeat the procedure number 3 several times to measure the weight of the body and note it down in the table. 5. Now, determine the average weight or force acting on the body Serial number Weight of the body (N) Average weight (N) 1.

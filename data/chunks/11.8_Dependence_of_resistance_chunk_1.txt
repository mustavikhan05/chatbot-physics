longer than that of Q. Its resistance is greater as it is longer. Law of length: The resistance of a conductor is directly proportional to its length when the cross sectional area, material and temperature of the conductor remain the same. If the length of the conductor is L, area of cross section is A, and its resistance is R, then according to this law, Figure: 11.7 Physics 183 R L ∝ , when temperature, material and A is constant. (11.1)  Figure: 11.8 Figure 11.8 shows two conducting wires S and T with the same length and made of the same material. The area of cross section of wire S is bigger than the area of cross section of wire T. Larger the area of cross section of a wire, the lower its resistance. Law of cross section: The resistance of a conductor is inversely proportional to its cross sectional area when the length, material and temperature of the conductor remain the same. That is, R ∝ 1 A  , when temperature, material and L is constant

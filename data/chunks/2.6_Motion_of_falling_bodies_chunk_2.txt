acceleration of the stone and that of the paper would be the same. So they should reach at the same time on the earth, but due to the resistance of air two bodies reach at different time on the earth. If there is no resistance of the air, they would fall at the same time. Laws of falling bodies : Galilio discovered three laws relating to falling bodies : These are called laws of falling bodies. These laws are applicable only for bodies falling from rest without any resistance. At the time of falling, the body will ``fall from rest, it will have no initial velocity. The body will fall freely without any resistance, that is, no force other than the gravitational force will act on the body. For example, the resistance due to air will not act on it. Laws of falling bodies are : First Law : All bodies falling from rest and from the same height without any resistance traverse equal distance in equal time. Second Law : The velocity (v), acquired by a freely falling body from rest in a given time (t) is directly proportional to time that is, v ‚àù t

It takes some time when sound reaches our ear from its source. The distance travelled by sound in one second is called velocity of sound. The velocity of sound depends on some factors. Nature of medium: Velocity of sound in different media is different. For example velocity of sound in air, water and iron is different. At 20°C the velocity of sound in air is 344ms-1, in water it is 1450ms-1 and in iron it is 5130ms-1. Generally we can see the velocity of sound in air is less, in liquid it is higher and highest in solid. V × t 2 Figure: 7.12 Physics  121  Do it yourself: Take two empty pots of tin. Connect the pots with a thin wire of approximately twenty meter long. Your friend is speaking through a pot. Try to hear that sound by putting your ear in contact with another pot. Can you hear what your friend is saying? Yes, I can. Here sound is travelling through the wire which is a solid substance.  Temperature: The more the temperature increases, the more the velocity of sound in the air increases. For this reason, the velocity of sound is more in summer than that of in winter. Calculate: The velocity of sound is 344ms-1 at 20˚C temperature and 332ms-1 at 0˚. How much does the velocity of sound increases for the increase of temperature by 1°C?  Humidity of air: The velocity of sound increases with the increase of humidity. For this reason, the velocity of sound is more in the humid air than that of in dry air.

And iii B. Creative Questions: 1.  Rima after combing her hair observes that her comb attracts small pieces of paper. Shima says that it happens so because the comb is charged positively. Rima says that the comb is charged negatively. To solve the problem, Rima and Shima look for their physics teacher and find him in the physics laboratory. Hearing everything he asks them to find the nature of charge with the help of an electroscope.  a) What do you mean by charge?  b) Explain why an object is charged by friction.  c) Describe why the comb is charged.  d) Explain how the nature of charge of the comb can be determined by the electroscope. 2.

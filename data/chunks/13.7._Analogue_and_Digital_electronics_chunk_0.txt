Analogue signal: The magnitude of some quantity which changes continuously is called analogue. The magnitude of the quantities such as sound, light, temperature, pressure can be of any value within a definite extent. Analogue data is sent continuously. Telephone, radio, television broadcast and cable television generally send analogue data. So the analogue signals are continuously changeable voltage or current. This voltage or current is normally changed and can receive any value between the lowest and the highest value. Analogue signal is really a sine wave. Audio and video voltages are the  Figure 13.1: Analogue signal

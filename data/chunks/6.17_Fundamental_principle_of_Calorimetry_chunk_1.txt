after applying heat. 4. Take the reading of the temperature every after each minute until all the ice melts. 5. Following the above procedure continue to apply heat even after all the ice melts and the temperature becomes 20°C-25°C. Record the temperature every after each minute. 6. Draw a temperature vs. time graph using the obtained data. 7. Find the melting point of ice from the graph. 8. Analyze the nature of the graph. Drawing of temperature vs. time graph. Investigation no. 6.2 Name of the Experiment: Determination of boiling point of water. Objective: To observe the boiling point of water and to find the relation between temperature and boiling point and to draw a graph. Apparatus: Thermometer, burner, beaker and stopwatch. Working Procedure: 1. Take some water in a beaker at room temperature. Place the thermometer in the water of the beaker in such a way that the bulb may not touch the wall of the beaker. 2. Heat the water with a burner and take the reading every after each minute to record the rise of temperature. 3. Notice that after reaching the temperature of 100°C, the temperature of water does not increase even after the application of more heat. 4. Draw a temperature vs. time graph on the basis of obtained data. 5. Determine the boiling point of water from the graph. 6. Analyze the nature of the graph. Drawing of temperature vs. time graph.

molecules, ions, electrons etc. or any specified group of these particles) equal to the number of atoms in 0.012 kilogram of Carbon-12. Fundamental quantities and their units SL No Name of Physical Quantities Symbol of quantities SI Unit Symbol for unit 1 Length L meter m 2 Mass m kilogram kg 3 Time T second s 4 Temperature θ,T Kelvin k 5 Electric current I ampere A 6 Luminous intensity IV candela cd 7 Amount of substance n mole mol Multiple and sub-multiple of units : Sometimes it is beneficial to use the fractions or multiples of fundamental units. When the value of a quantity is very big or small, the prefixes mentioned in the following table is very essential. For example, if we consider the distance of two molecules of air, we can see the distance is very small and it is 0.00000001 m. If we use this number frequently, we have to be careful about the number of zero’s every time to see weather it is mentioned accurately or not. But if we mentioned the number by a prefix we will write 0.01µm instead of 0.00000001m. Here the symbol µ refers to the prefix 10-6. Similarly if we mentioned the power of newly built electricity production center is 2000 x 106 w = 2000mw instead of 2000000000w, it will be more convenient. The use of indices of 10 before the unit of the following prefixes is approved to be use in SI system.

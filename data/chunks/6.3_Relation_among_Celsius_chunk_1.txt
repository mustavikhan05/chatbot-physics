different ways to prepare different scales of temperature. There are three scales of temperature in use – Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin scale. The units of temperature of these three scales are °C, °F and K respectively. The lower fixed point in Celsius scale is 0°C, in Fahrenheit scale 32°F and in Kelvin scale it is 273K. The upper fixed point in Celsius scale is 100°C, in Fahrenheit scale 212°F and in Kelvin scale it is 373K. Fig: 6.3 P Physics 103 Establishing a relation among different scales of temperature: Let A and B be the lower fixed point and upper fixed point of a thermometer respectively (figure 6.3). Three more thermometers graduated in Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin scale are kept side by side. The readings of the point P of the thermometer AB in other three scales are C, F and K respectively. Therefore the readings of distance PA in these three scales are C-0, F-32 and K-273 respectively. Since PA BA is a constant it can be written, PA BA = C-0 100-0  = F-32 212-32 = K-273 373-273 or, C 100 = F-32 180  = K-273 100 or, C 5  = F-32 9  = K-273 5

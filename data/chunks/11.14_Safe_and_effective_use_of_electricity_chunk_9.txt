c. ii and iii (d) i, ii and iii B.  Creative questions 1.  The length and cross-sectional area of nichrome wire used in an electrical heater, is 30 m and 2 × 10-7 m2 respectively. The resistivity of nichrome is 100 × 10-8  Ω m. The nichrome wire is replaced by a copper wire of identical length and cross- sectional area. The resistivity of copper is 1.7 × 10-8  Ω m.  a. What is resistance?  b. Why the resistance of conductor increases with increasing temperature.  c. Determine the resistance of copper wire.  d. Analyze the logic of using copper wire. Physics  197 2.  Alvi uses a bulb of 220V-100W during his study for 3 hours daily. On the contrary his brother Alif uses a table lamp of 220V-40W for 4 hours daily. The cost of each unit of electrical energy is 3.5 taka.  a. Write down the Ohm’s law.  b. Explain, what will be the change in resistance of a conductor if the length is increased by 5 times provided that the temperature, material and area of cross- section remain unchanged?  c. Determine the current of the lamp used by Alif. d.

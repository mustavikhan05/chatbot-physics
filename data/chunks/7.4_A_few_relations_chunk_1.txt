and time period: We know that the number of complete vibrations of a vibrating particle in one second is called its frequency. Frequency is denoted by ƒ. Again the time period is the time of one complete vibration. If the time period is T, then in T second, the number of vibration is 1 Therefore, the number of vibration in one second is T 1 The number of vibration in 1 second is frequency. So, the frequency, ƒ= 1 T (7.1) The relation between wave velocity and wavelength: We know that number of complete vibrations in one second is called frequency. Again the distance travelled by the wave during one complete oscillation is called wavelength. So, if the wavelength is λ, therefore, the distance travelled in the time of 1 complete vibration= λ ∴ the distance travelled in the time of f complete vibrations = ƒλ Since the frequency is ƒ, so f numbers of waves are produced in 1 second. ∴ the distance travelled in one second by the wave = ƒλ This is the velocity of wave, v. Therefore, velocity of wave, v = ƒλ … … … (7.2) Mathematical example 7.1: The wavelength of sound produced by an object in the air is 20cm .If the velocity of sound in the air is 340ms-1, find the frequency and period of the object. We know, Velocity= ƒλ  ƒ Hz m ms v 1700 20 .0 / 340 1 = = = − λ   T= 1 f  = 1 1700s-1  = 0.000588s=5.88×10-4s The frequency 1700 Hz; Period (time) 05.88×10-4s

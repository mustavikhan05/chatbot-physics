To drive vehicles like car, motor cycle etc. safely the driver should have an eye to many things. At the very first, he has to check all the lamps in the car by switching them on. For perfect and safe driving, the drivers need not only to see what remains in front of him. Instead, he has to be careful about what remains behind the car. The mirrors are very important and indispensible parts of a car.  For this, he has to adjust all the mirrors just after he gets on the car.

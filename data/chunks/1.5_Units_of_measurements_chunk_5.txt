second (s). Unit of temperature : Kelvin : The temperature which equals to 1 273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water is called one Kelvin (k). Unit of electric current : Ampere : The ampere is that current which produces a force of 2x10-7 Newton per meter in vacuum between two parallel infinitely long conductors of negligible cross-sectional area 1 meter apart when each conductor carries the same current. Unit of luminous intensity: Candela : Candela is the  quantity of luminous intensity of any source of light which radiates monochromatic radiation at a particular direction with a frequency of 540x1012 Hz and emissive power of 1 683 watt per steredian solid angle. second is defined as one meter (m). 10  Physics Unit of amount of substance : Mole : The mole is defined as the amount of substance which contains elementary entities (e.g atoms, molecules, ions, electrons etc. or any specified group of these particles) equal to the number of atoms in 0.012 kilogram of Carbon-12.

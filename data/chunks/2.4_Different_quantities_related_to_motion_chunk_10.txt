along the direction of velocity or opposite to the velocity. If the velocity increases than the change of velocity takes place along the velocity. In this case acceleration will be positive. If the velocity decreases then the change of velocity takes 36 Physics place opposite to the velocity. In this case acceleration will be negative and is called retardation or deceleration. Dimension : The dimension of acceleration is the dimension of velocity / time That is, acceleration = velocity time = displacement   1 time time  = displacement   time2

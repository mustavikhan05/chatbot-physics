calculate the current of secondary coil. We know: Ip Is Es Ep = Or, Is= A V A V Ip Es Ep 3 20 6 10 = × = × Ans: 3A Mathematical example: 12.2.The number of turns of primary coil in a transformer is 50, voltage 210V. If the number of turns in the secondary coil is 100, what will be the voltage? We know: Ep Es = np ns Es = ns np × Ep = 100 50 × 210V = 420V  Ans: 420V Mathematical Example: 12.3.The number of turns of primary coil in a transformer is 18 and the number of turns of secondary coil is 90. If the electric current of primary coil is 7A, what will be the electric current of secondary coil? We know, Is Ip = np ns Is = np ns × Ip .˙. Is=18 90 × 7A = 7 5  A = 1.4 A Ans: 1.4A  Here, the voltage primary coil, Ep=10V the voltage of secondary coil, Es=20V The current of primary coil Ep=6A The current of secondary coil, Is=? Here, The number of round of primary coil, np=50 The voltage of primary coil, Ep=210V The number of round of secondary coil, ns=100 the voltage of secondary coil, Es=? Physics  207 Exercise  A.

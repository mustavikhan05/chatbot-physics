resistance of the material of a conductor = ρ Therefore, the conductivity of its material is 1 σ ρ = As unit of ρ is Ω m, Therefore, the unit of σ is (Ω m)-1. Mathematics Example 11.2:  The specific resistance of the nichrome wire used in an electrical heater is 100 × 10-8 Ω m. What will be the resistance of 15 m long wire having cross sectional area 2.0 × 10-7 m2? We know,  L R A ρ =  = 8 7 2 (100 10 m)(15m)

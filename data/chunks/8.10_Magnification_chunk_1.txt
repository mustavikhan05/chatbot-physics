object. Magnification is used to measure how large or small the size of the image is compared to that of the object formed in a mirror or a lens. In other words, the ratio of the length of the image of that object is called linear magnification or in short magnification. If an image of length l′ is formed in a mirror or a lens for an object of length l, then magnification of the object is the ratio of l′  to l. Therefore, l m l ′ =  (8.3) From the magnitude of magnification m, we know how many times larger or smaller the image is compared to that of the object. Investigation 8.1 To Form and demonstrate an image using a concave mirror. Objective: Use of a concave mirror in the laboratory and formation of a real image. Instrument: A concave mirror. Procedure: 1. Take a concave mirror. 2. Stand beside a door or a window of your laboratory with the mirror. 3. Now hold the mirror towards any external scene, for example- trees, buildings, etc. 4. Form an image of the scenery on a very adjacent smooth wall,  by moving the mirror right and left. 5. Move the mirror back and forth from the wall to make the image distinct. 6. At a certain distance, you will see a distinct image of the object on the wall. 7. Thus a distinct image of an object at a long distance can be demonstrated on a wall. 8. Discuss about the nature of the image. 140  Physics Exercise A. Multiple choice questions Tick (√ ) the correct answer. 1.  Where convex mirrors are used? a. cars

had to conduct his research work in night many times. In the laboratory he researched a lot about, how radio signals can be transmitted to a distant place without the help of wire and succeeded. In 1895, for the first time in history he sent radio signal to a distant place without wire and demonstrated in public. He has mentionable contributions in micro- wave research. He was the first who was able to reduce the wavelength of generated Physics 229 wave to millimeter level (about 5 mm). He was the first to use a semiconductor junction to detect radio signal. Instead of taking commercial benefit from this invention, he opened it for all, so that others can develop this research more. Subsequently, Jagadish Chandra Bose made a number of important and pioneering discoveries in plant physiology. Among these, invention of crescograph to record the growth of plants, extremely slight movement and how plants respond to various stimuli are notable. His major contribution in the field of bio-physics is the nature of conduction of the stimuli in plants. Earlier it was thought that, the nature of response of plants to different stimuli is chemical, but he became able to show that it is electric in nature. In 1917 he established ‘Bose Biggan Mandir’ in Kolkata in order to research about plant physiology. His writings in Bengali language are compiled in a book named ‘Abyakta’. ‘Response in the Living and Non-Living’ is a mentionable book of him. Jagadish Chandra Bose expired dated on 23rd November 1937.

The forth state of matter is called plasma state. This plasma is the ionized gas at very high temperature. The main source of plasma is the Sun. Except this the other stars are also the sources of plasma. The plasma state is formed at a few thousand degrees of temperature. Plasma has no definite shape and volume like gases. The plasma particles carry charges and act as conductor of electricity. Metals substances are cut by plasma torch in the industry. Investigation: 5.1 To determine the density of a solid Objective: To find the density of a solid body of any shape. Apparatus: Measuring cylinder, balance, a solid substance of any shape. Theory: The space occupied by a solid substance is called its volume and the mass per unit volume of a body is called density. When a solid is dipped into liquid it displaces liquid equal to its own volume. The readings of the water level before and after the immersion of the solid in the measuring cylinder are V1cm3 and V2cm3. ∴The volume of the solid, V = (V2 –V1) cm3… … … (1) Let M gm be the mass of the body, therefore density, d = M gm V cm3  = M V

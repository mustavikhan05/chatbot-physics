help of diagram. D. General questions 1. What do you mean by the reflection of light? 2. What do you mean by regular and irregular reflection? 3. What is a mirror? 4. What is called an image? How many types of images are there? What are they? 5. How real image is formed in a concave mirror? Demonstrate with the help of ray diagram. 6. How virtual image is formed in a concave mirror? Demonstrate with the help of figure. 142  Physics Chapter nine REFRACTION OF LIGHT   [A straight stick appears to be bent when it is obliquely immersed partly in water. If we look directly to the bottom of a jug full of transparent water its bottom seems to be raised up. Of course we observe these phenomena in our everyday life. These events results from a special property of light called refraction. A special event of refraction is total internal reflection. Mirage is formed in the desert, diamond looks bright and information signals are sent through optical fiber because of total internal reflection of light. Many of us use spectacles to remove the defects of eyes. The glass of the spectacle is a lens. We will discuss all these phenomena in this chapter.] By the end of this chapter we will be able to - 1. Explain the laws of refraction 2. Explain the refractive index 3. Explain the total internal reflection 4. Explain the use of optical fiber 5. Explain the lens and its classification 6. Describe the different quantities of lens by drawing ray diagram 7. Describe the image formed by the lens by drawing ray diagram 8. Describe the power of lens 9. Describe the function of eyes by drawing ray diagram 10. Describe least distance of distinct vision 11. Describe the defects of eyes 12. Describe the uses of lens to remedy the defects of eye by drawing ray diagram 13. Explain the perception of coloured objects 14. Describe the uses of refraction of light in our everyday life  Physics  143

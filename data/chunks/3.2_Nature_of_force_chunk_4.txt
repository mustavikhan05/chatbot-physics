nucleon. The strong force that exists between two nucleons within the nucleus of an atom is called strong nuclear force. This force bounds the nucleons together. The strong nuclear force is responsible for the stability of the nucleus. This force is very short range and attractive. The range of this force is 10-15 m which is the radius of the nucleus. This force is the strongest among the fundamental forces. Physics 53

material medium between the source of sound and the listener, and the frequency will be in between 20Hz to 20000Hz. Characteristics of sound wave: Vibration of an objects produces sound wave and an elastic material medium is needed for its propagation. So, sound is called a mechanical wave. Since the direction of propagation of wave and of particles are in the same direction, so is longitudinal. The velocity of sound wave depends on the nature of the medium. The velocity of sound in gaseous medium is less, high in liquid and higher in solid. The intensity of sound wave is directly to the square of its amplitude. So higher the amplitude, the higher is the intensity. Reflection, refraction and superposition are possible in case of sound wave. The velocity of sound wave depends on the temperature and the humidity of medium too.

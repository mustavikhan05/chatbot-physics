reaction force will exist as long as the there is action. Walking on road In our daily life we walk or run on the ground [Figure 3.6]. When we walk on the ground, we exert a backward force on the ground by the leg behind obliquely. This is the action force. According to the third law a reaction force is produced opposite to this. We are able to walk on the road due to this reaction force. Figure 3.6 58 Physics Firing by a gun When a person fire with a gun, he feels a backward push at that time. What is the reason behind this? In this case, action and reaction force of bullet and gun exists for the same time. According to the Newton’s second law of motion, the bullet and the gun acquire equal and opposite momentum. As a result the bullet moves forward with a particular momentum and the gun moves backward with a momentum of same magnitude but opposite in direction. Due to this, the person will feel a backward thrust. The backward velocity of the gun will be smaller in comparison to that of the bullet as the mass of the gun is large. Collision Among you, those who have played marble probably had seen how one marble hits another marble. In addition, you are familiar with different types of road accident through newspapers or television. These events are the practical examples of collision. Therefore, when a moving object hits another body at rest or in motion, then it is said that a collision has taken place. During collision a force acts on each of the two bodies. If the force exerted by the first body on the second body is called action force, then the force exerted by the second body on the first one is called the reaction force. These two forces acting during collision are same in magnitude but opposite in direction. No other external force acts during the collision except the action and reaction force. From Newton’s second law we get, mv mu F t − =  We can express the change of momentum from this equation as-

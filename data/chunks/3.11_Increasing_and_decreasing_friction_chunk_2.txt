spot. Possibly you have seen how truck and bus is blocked in a slippery or muddy road in the rainy days. What is the reason behind this? This is due to the large decrease in friction. So friction is to be increased according to the necessity. The car tyres are so designed that they are able to grip the road properly and create necessary frictional force. Therefore the surface of the tyres are designed with treads i.e. grooves and teeth. In the rainy days, the water or mud enters the grooves and water and mud are thrown outside boldly. As a result, the tyres are able to grip the road surface well. Physics  65 i.e. friction can be increased by making the surface rough. Mountain climbing Mountain climbers need to grip the rock or mountain surface with their hands and feet, in order to climb a mountain. They use chalk powder to grip the rock. There are spikes under the boot of players so that they do not fall down while running.

reading. Now it is to be noted which vernier scale mark coincides with which of the main scale mark. If no vernier mark coincide with a main scale mark then find out the nearest vernier mark. The reading of this mark that is the number of vernier scale divisions from the left to this mark, is the vernier scale reading. Suppose the Vth vernier mark coincides with or nearest with any main scale mark. Hence the vernier constant of the instrument is VC. 16

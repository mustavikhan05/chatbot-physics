We know, mirrors are of two types. (A) Plane mirror (B) Spherical mirror. We will discuss how images are formed in plane and spherical mirrors. Physics  133 Formation of image in a plane mirror (A) Point object In figure 8.12, O is an object in front of a plane mirror M1M2. Ray OT from the point O incident normally on the plane mirror and reflected back along TO. Another ray OQ incident obliquely on the mirror and reflected along the path QR. If the reflected rays QR and TO are extended backward, they meet at the point I. As if the reflected rays are coming from the point I situated behind the mirror. Therefore, the point I is the virtual image of the point O.  Figure: 8.12 The normal QN is drawn at the point Q. Since TO and QN are parallel, OQ is the interjector. ∴∠TOQ = ∠OQN = i (8.1) Again, OI and QN are parallel, line RQI has intersected them. ∴∠TIQ = ∠NQR = r (8.2) We know, i = r We get from equations (8.1) and

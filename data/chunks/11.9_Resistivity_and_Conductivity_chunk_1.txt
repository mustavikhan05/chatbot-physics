unit, then, R ρ = . Therefore, at a particular temperature, the resistance of a conductor of unit length and unit cross sectional area is called the specific resistance of that material at that temperature. At a certain temperature, the resistance of a conductor depends on its physical conditions (e.g. length, cross section etc.). But the resistivity of a conductor depends only on its material. Unit of specific resistance: Rewriting equation (11.3) we can write, ρ = R A L (11.4) Substituting the units of the quantities on the right side of the equation, the unit of ρ is 2 m m m Ω = Ω  184

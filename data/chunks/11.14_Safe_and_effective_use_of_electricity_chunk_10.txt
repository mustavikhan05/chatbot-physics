for 3 hours daily. On the contrary his brother Alif uses a table lamp of 220V-40W for 4 hours daily. The cost of each unit of electrical energy is 3.5 taka. a. Write down the Ohm’s law. b. Explain, what will be the change in resistance of a conductor if the length is increased by 5 times provided that the temperature, material and area of cross- section remain unchanged? c. Determine the current of the lamp used by Alif. d. Who is economical between Alvi and Alif considering money? Analyze with mathematical arguments. C. General questions 1. What is electric current? 2. What are directions of the conventional current flow and electron flow? 3. What are conductor, insulator and semiconductor material? 4. State the Ohm’s law. 5. Show that, V=IR. 6. Plot a graph of I versus V in a graph paper. 7. Define specific resistance. 8. Show that, the value of the equivalent resistance of resistors connected in series is equal to the sum of the different resistances included in the combination. 9. What are the causes of using electrical energy can be dangerous? 10.  A current of 2.5 A is flowing through the filament of the headlight of a motor car. If the potential difference between the two ends of the filament is 12 V, what is the resistance? 11. The electromotive force of a dry cell is 1.5 V.

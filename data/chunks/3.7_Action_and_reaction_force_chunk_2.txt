by the first body on the second body is called action force, then the force exerted by the second body on the first one is called the reaction force. These two forces acting during collision are same in magnitude but opposite in direction. No other external force acts during the collision except the action and reaction force. From Newton’s second law we get, mv mu F t − = We can express the change of momentum from this equation as- F t mv mu × = − (3.4) i.e.  force × time = change of momentum. The product of force and time is defined as impulse of force. Therefore, impulse of force = change of momentum Let two bodies A and B having masses m1 and m2 are moving with velocities u1 and u2 respectively along a straight line. If the velocity of A is greater than that of B, at any time the object A will collide with the object B [Figure 3.7].  The force exerted on B by A is the action F1. The object B will also exert a force F2 on A, this F2 is the reaction force. According to Newton’s third law of motion, 1 2 F F = −

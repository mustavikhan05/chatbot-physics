We can increase  the magnetic field intensity  by coiling the above mentioned wire (see the figure 12.3).Due to flow of the current through the coil, most of the lines of the force will be concentrated in the centre of the coil. The magnetic field will be look alike the magnetic field of bar magnet. This type of coil is called Solenoid. If we insert any iron rod through it, the iron rod will be turned into magnet. If we stop the current, it will not remain magnet. If the direction of current is changed, the pole of magnet will be changed. Through this process, the iron is turned into magnet which is called electromagnet.   Figure: 12.1 Figure: 12.2 Figure: 12.3 200  Physics

Critical angle: When ray of light passes from a denser medium to a rarer medium, then the refracted ray is deviated away from the normal. As a result the angle of refraction becomes greater than the angle of incidence. 1. Suppose AB is the separating surface of glass and air. Glass is denser and air is rarer medium. P is a point in the glass medium. From P a ray of light PQ incidents at point Q of separating surface AB at a small angle. QR is the refracted ray in air [Fig: 9.7(a)]. In this case the angle of refraction (∠NQR) will be greater than the angle of incidence (∠PQN′).

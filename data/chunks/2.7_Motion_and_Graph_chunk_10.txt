uniform acceleration a starting from rest. What will be the traveled distance of the body at a given time ? (i) s = (u+v)t 2 (ii) âˆ´ s = ut + 1 2 at2 (iii) s2 = u2 + 2at Which one of the following is the correct (a) i (b) ii (c) ii & iii (d) i, ii & iii 5. Which one of the velocity-time graph below does represent the graph of freely falling body ? (a) A (b) B (c) C (d) D 6. Creative question Rajib with his family members started for visiting Jaflong in Sylhet by microbus.He recorded the magnitude velocity i.e. speed of the car from the speedometer after every 5min throughout the journey. The magnitude of velocity he got per hour was 18, 36, 54, 45, 54, 36, and 18 kilometer. a)  What is instantaneous speed ? b)  Explain the acceleration of an object moving with uniform velocity. c)  Find the distance traveled by the car in first 5min. d)  Draw and explain the velocity-time graph by the collected data. 48  Physics Chapter three FORCE

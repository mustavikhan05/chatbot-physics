mass per unit volume of a body is called density. When a solid is dipped into liquid it displaces liquid equal to its own volume. The readings of the water level before and after the immersion of the solid in the measuring cylinder are V1cm3 and V2cm3. ∴The volume of the solid, V = (V2 –V1) cm3… … … (1) Let M gm be the mass of the body, therefore density, d = M gm V cm3 = M V × 103 Kg m-3 … … … (2) Working procedure: 1. Measure the mass of the solid substance by a balance. 2. Fill up the half portion of the measuring cylinder with water and take the reading of the upper level of the water. 3. Tie the solid by a string and dip it into the water of the cylinder so that it stays at the bottom of it. When the water comes to a standstill position take the reading of the upper level of the water. 4. Repeat working process 2 and 3 taking different amount of water in the measuring cylinder and write down the readings in the table. 5. Find the volume of the solid substance with the help of necessary calculations. Using equation no.2 determine the density of the solid substance.

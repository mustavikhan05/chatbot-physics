We have already known about rest, motion, displacement, velocity, acceleration etc. We can see different types of objects around us. Some of them are in rest and some of them are in motion. Among the bodies in rest, there are chair, table, houses, log of wood etc. Can a body in rest move itself? Tonight your reading table is in a certain place. Will it be in the same place in the next morning? What do we observe from these practical experiences? It is observed that the bodies at rest are still at rest. These bodies can’t move by themselves. Suppose that one of your friends is riding a bi-cycle on a plane road. At any moment he stopped paddling the cycle. Will the cycle stop at once? We find that the cycle will stop slowly after crossing a small distance. Would the cycle move continuously if there is no air resistance and friction? From this evidence we can understand that everybody has the tendency to remain in the same state as it is. If the body is at rest it continues to be at rest. On the other hand if the body is in motion it continues to be in motion. This tendency or property of a body to maintain its own state is called inertia. Thus the tendency of a body to maintain its own state for ever in which the body is at present or the property of a body to preserve that state is defined as inertia. The inertia of a body depends on its mass. That is, mass is the measure of its inertia. The more the mass, the more the inertia of a body. In other words, it is difficult to move, increase or decrease velocity or change the direction of velocity of a body whose inertia is large. Do yourself • Keep a pen and a book on a table. Now strike the pen with finger. What do you observe? The pen moved a small distance on the

Figure: 11.9 Series circuit The circuit in which the electric components are connected one after another in a single loop is called a series circuit. By arranging a cell E, two bulbs B1 and B2 one after another a series circuit is formed in figure 11.9. As there is a single path in the circuit, the same current will flow throughout the whole circuit. Now if the ammeter is connected at the points A, B or C, the value of the electric current will found to be the same. The little bulbs that are used for decoration purpose in wedding ceremony or in different programs are connected in series. We increase the voltage by connecting more than one battery in series in a torch light. The ammeter is connected in series to measure the electric current in a circuit. Parallel circuit The circuit in which the electric components are arranged in such a way that one terminal of all the components are joined at a common point and the other terminal are joined at another common point then this circuit is called a parallel circuit. In figure 11.10 one end of the bulbs B1 and B2 are connected at the point and the other end at the point b and so formed a parallel circuit. In a parallel circuit there are alternative paths for the current to flow.  Figure: 11.3 186  Physics Say, the total current in the circuit is I which splits into two parts I1 and I2 at the junction a. Let I1 and I2 are the currents flowing through the bulbs B1 and B2 respectively. At the junction b the currents I1 and I2 recombine to form the current I again. If the current at the points P, Q and R is measured by an ammeter, then it will be found that 1 2 I I I = +  Here, total current of the circuit I =

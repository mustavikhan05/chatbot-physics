W1> W2, i.e. when the weight of the body is greater than the buoyancy of the liquid the body sinks. In this case the weight of the body is more than the weight of the displaced liquid. b) If W1=W2 i.e. when the weight of the body equals to the buoyancy of the liquid the body floats being fully immersed in liquid. In such situation the weight of the body is equal to the weight of the liquid displaced. c) If W1<W2 i.e. the weight of the body is less than the buoyancy of the liquid, the body does not sink. It floats being partly immersed in liquid. In such a position the weight of the body is less than the displaced water. 5.9 : Archimedes Law: From the experience of our daily life we observe that any solid substance when immersed in liquid it appears lighter. Its cause is on an immersing body vertically upward force or buoyancy acts on it. Before 300 B.C. the Greek philosopher Archimedes invented that if a body is partly or fully immersed in a liquid or gas in equilibrium, it seems to have lost a part of its weight. This apparent loss of weight is equal to the weight of the displaced liquid or gas. Experiment: Take a body of known weight. Tie the body by a light thread and dip it into a container completely filled with water. Some water will spill out of the vessel. Take the weight of the body in completely submersed condition. Now find out the apparent loss of weight by subtracting the weight of the body immersed in water from the known weight of the body in air. Now determine the weight of the spilled out water. It will be observed that the apparent loss of weight of the body is equal to the weight of the displaced liquid. Thus we may have a proof of Archimedesâ€™ principle in a simple way.

Electromotive force Electrical energy is needed to produce electric current in a circuit. The electromotive force of an electrical energy source is defined as the work done by the source or the energy spent by the source in driving a unit positive charge from one point of the circuit to the same point by traversing the complete circuit along with the source. If the work done is W J in bringing Q C of charge in a complete circuit, then the work done in bringing 1 C of charge is W Q . Therefore the electromotive force of the source is, W E Q =

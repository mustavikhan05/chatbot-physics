the lens. 150 Physics Focal length: The distance of the principal focus from the optical centre of a lens is called the focal length of the lens. Focal length is expressed by f. In the figure 9.13 OF is the focal length of the lens. Figure: 9.13 Focal plane: The imaginary plane at the principal focus perpendicular to the principal axis is called focal plane of the lens. In the figure 9.14 ABCD is the focal plane of the lens. Figure: 9.14 Rules of drawing ray diagram in lens: 1. Rays of light incident in a direction through the optical centre of a lens is refracted along the same straight line without any deviation (Fig: 9.15 A and B) 2. Rays incident in a direction parallel to the principal axis after refraction passes through the principal focus (in the case of a convex lens) [9.15 (C) ] or appear to diverge from the principal focus (in the case of a concave lens) [9.15 (D)]. 3. A ray of light incidents through the principal focus (in the case of a convex lens) [9.15 (E)] or directed towards the principal focus (in the case of concave lens) [9.15 (F)] after refraction through the lens becomes parallel to the principal axis.

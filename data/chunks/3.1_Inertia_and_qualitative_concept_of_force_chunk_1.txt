body depends on its mass. That is, mass is the measure of its inertia. The more the mass, the more the inertia of a body. In other words, it is difficult to move, increase or decrease velocity or change the direction of velocity of a body whose inertia is large. Do yourself • Keep a pen and a book on a table. Now strike the pen with finger. What do you observe? The pen moved a small distance on the table. • Now repeat this procedure for the book. The book won’t move. Now push the book with your hand. The book will be displaced from its original position. Between the pen and the book, it needs more effort to move the book as the mass i.e. the inertia of the book is greater. If a bus at rest suddenly starts moving the passengers lean backwards. The reason behind this is inertia. When the bus is at rest, the bodies of the passengers are also at rest. When the bus starts moving, the part of the passenger’s body attached to the bus also moves with it. But the upper part of the body tends to remain stationary due to inertia of rest. Thus the upper part of the body lags behind with respect to the lower part. As a result the passenger inclines backwards. On the other hand, when a sudden brake is applied in a moving bus the passengers lean forwards. When a bus is in motion, the passenger of the bus is also in the same speed of the bus. When the bus stops suddenly, the lower part of 50

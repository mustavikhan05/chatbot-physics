When a potential difference is applied between the two terminals of a conductor, an electric current is set up. Due to this, work is done and the electrons acquire energy. This electrical energy may be transformed into different forms of energy (e.g.- heat, light, mechanical energy etc.) according to the nature of the circuit.  Figure 11.13 Say, AB is a conductor of resistance R and Q amount of charge is flowing through it. The potential difference between the points A and B is V. We know, if the potential difference between the two terminals of a conductor is 1 volt and 1 coulomb charge flows through it, then the amount of work done or energy spent is 1joule.  Now, if Q coulomb charge flows through the conductor, the amount of work done = VQ joule. Therefore, energy spent or the amount of energy converted is W VQ =  Again, electric current, Q I t =  or, Q It =  ∴  W VIt =    (11.11) Using ohm’s law this relationship can be expressed as below, ∴ 2 2 V W VIt I Rt t R = = = Joule  (11.12) Electric power The electric appliances which we use in houses or in offices are generally marked with the voltage by which it runs and the electric power in watt. We know the rate of work done or the rate of energy conversion is called power. Therefore, the rate at which energy is converted into other forms in an electric device is its power. Therefore, power = Work done time = energy converted time  ∴ W P t =

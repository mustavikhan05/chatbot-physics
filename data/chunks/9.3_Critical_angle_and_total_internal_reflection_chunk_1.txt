refraction becomes greater than the angle of incidence. 1. Suppose AB is the separating surface of glass and air. Glass is denser and air is rarer medium. P is a point in the glass medium. From P a ray of light PQ incidents at point Q of separating surface AB at a small angle. QR is the refracted ray in air [Fig: 9.7(a)]. In this case the angle of refraction (∠NQR) will be greater than the angle of incidence (∠PQN′). 2. Now in denser medium if the angle of incidence gradually increases, the corresponding angle of refraction in rarer medium will also increase. In this way if the angle of incidence is increased finally for a definite angle of incidence ∠P1QN′ will be Given,  Angle of incidence, i= 30° Angle of refraction, r= 19° Refractive index of water with respect to air, anw =?

be considered a straight line. Then the velocity at the point P = distant represented by AC time interval represented by BC or v = AC BC But it is difficult to get correct result by measuring such a small triangle. So we draw a tangent ED at the point P and draw a greater triangle DEF similar to ABC. Now from the triangles ABC and DEF We get, AC BC = DF EF ∴ v = DF EF But, DF EF  is the slope of ED Therefore, the velocity at the point P is the slope or gradient of the tangent drawn at that point. Thus it may be said that the gradient of the tangent at any point on the distance- time graph represents the velocity at that point. 2. Velocity – time graph The velocity of an object moving with non-uniform velocity depends on time. This relation can be expressed by a graph. In this case time (t) is plotted along X-axis and velocity (v) along Y-axis. This graph is called velocity-time graph. We can find velocity and acceleration i.e. the rate of change of velocity with time from the graph easily. The method of finding acceleration from velocity-time graph in case uniform acceleration is discussed below. In case of uniform acceleration : When a body moves with uniform acceleration, its velocity increases equally for equal intervals of time. Hence the velocity-time graph will be a straight line (fig 2.7). Now let us take a point P on this graph and draw a normal PM on the X-axis from P. Then the change of velocity PM for any time interval of OM is obtained.

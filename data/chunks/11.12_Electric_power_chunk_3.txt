(11.14) Applying Ohm’s law P can be expressed in terms of V, I and R as below- 2 2 V P VI I R R = = = (11.15) We know the unit of power is watt (W). In the calculations of electric energy generally kW, MW etc. are used instead of watt. 1 kW=103 W and 1 MW=106 W. The power of some of the electric appliances which we use in our houses is mentioned below. The power of an electric bulb is generally 40, 60 and 100 W.  The power of an electric fan is found to 65-75 W commonly. Power of a television is generally 60-70 W. The energy saving bulbs which we use now-a-days has power of 11-30 W. Besides this, we use refrigerator, heater, iron etc. in houses- their power is more. So, it is commended not to use these appliances during peak hour. Calculation of electrical energy spent We have to pay for the electrical energy we utilize in our houses, shops, mills and factories. There is an electricity meter in the houses those use electricity, which maintain the accounts of spent electrical energy. Throughout the world, the electricity supply authority measures the amount of electrical energy consumed in units of kilowatt-hour (kWh). We call this kilowatt-hour unit as ‘board of trade’ unit or in brief ‘unit’. From the difference of the readings of two times in the electricity meter, we get the amount of consumed electric power during this period. Since power, P = Work done time = Converted energy time   W t =  ∴

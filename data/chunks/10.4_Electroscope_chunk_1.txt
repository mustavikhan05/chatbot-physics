this situation, if the glass is removed but the gap between the leaves is not reduced, then it can be decided that the electroscope is charged with positive ions. To charge the electroscope with negative ions, an ebonite rod should be rubbed with flannel and this negatively charged ebonite rod be allowed to touch the disk in the above mentioned process. As a result, the gold leaves of the electroscope will be charged Figure: 10.5 Figure: 10.6 Figure: 10.7 164 Physics negatively and they will repel each other and will remain in that position. The more is the quantity of charge the more will be the gap between the leaves. Detection of existence of electric charge: To determine the presence of charge in any body, the body may be brought to an unchanged electroscope. If the two leaves move away from each other then it is understood that there is an existence of charge in the body but if they donâ€™t move away from each other then it is understood that the body has no charge. Detection of the nature of charge: To know the nature of charge in any charged body, the electroscope should be charged either positively or negatively. Suppose the electroscope is charged positively. In this position, the leaves having positive charge will stay apart. Now if the experimental body is brought in contact with the disk of the electroscope and if the gap between the leaves decreases, then it is understood that the body is charged negatively. On the other hand if the gap increases due to touching the disk with the experimental body, then it is understood that the body is positively charged.

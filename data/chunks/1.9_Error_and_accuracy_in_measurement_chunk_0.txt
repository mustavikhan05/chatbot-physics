All measurements have some limitations of accuracy. Accuracy of measurement depend on the skill of observer and the instruments used. Suppose a meter scale is graduated in centimeter and millimeter. If we want to measure the length of this book we will get the result probably up to 0.1cm accurately. In Accuracy may be reduced in case of measuring the length of a house because the scale is to be used several time for measuring the full length. Every time the position of the front edge of the scale has to be marker on the floor. This increases the source of error thus increasing the probability of errors. The accuracy of measurement is as important as measurement itself. So, the observer should mention the degree of accuracy of result with the result of the experiment. Let the length of this book be 26.0cm ± 0.1cm. Here the symbol ± means that the real length of the book is between 25.9cm and 26.1cm. Here 0.1cm is the uncertainty or error of measurement. Generally there are three types of error in measurement. There are : a) Random error b) Instrumental error c) Personal error a) Random error : The error for which irrelevant occur in measured results by measuring a constant quantities. Several times is random error. The word random itself implies that the error cannot be guessed earlier and expected value will be zero. This is because measured values moves around the accurate value and average value of the errors should be zero if the value of the quantity is measured by the same instrument. The random error will be included as much as many time the scale is used to measure the floor. Each time the front edge marking on the floor falls a little back and forth of the accurate mark. Another random error takes place with the measurement when the meter scale is placed at the previous marking (slightly error position) as back edge starts from

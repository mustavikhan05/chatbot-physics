sphere is called the secondary axis. In figure 8.7, Pâ€²C is the secondary axis. Physics 131 Principal focus: A beam of rays adjacent and parallel to the principal axis being incident on a spherical mirror converges at a point on the principal axis (in case of concave mirror) or appears to be diverging from a point on the principal axis (in case of convex mirror) after reflection, then this point is called the principal focus of the mirror. Figure: 8.8 Figure: 8.9 Focal length: The distance between the pole and the principal focus of a spherical mirror is called the focal length of the mirror. In figure 8.8 and 8.9, PF is the focal length. In a spherical mirror, the focal length is half of the radius of curvature. Therefore, 2 r f = . Focal plane: The plane imagined that passes through the principal focus and perpendicular to the principal axis is called the focal plane.

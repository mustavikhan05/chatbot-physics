and Coefficient of Volume Expansion: The volume of a solid substance increases if its temperature is increased. It is called volume expansion. Let, the initial volume of a substance be V1 and initial temperature be θ1. When the temperature is raised to θ2, its volume becomes V2 after being increased. There increase in volume is V2 – V1 and increase of temperature = θ2 - θ1. Now if the coefficient of volume expansion is represented by γ, then γ = … … … (6.4)  = In equation 6.4 if the initial volume V1 = 1m3 and increase of temperature, θ2 - θ1 = 1K, then γ = V2 – V1 = increase in volume. Therefore, the increase in volume of a solid of volume 1m3 for a rise of temperature 1K is called the coefficient of volume expansion of the material of the solid. The coefficient of volume expansion of copper is 50.1 10-6 m3 means that if the temperature of a copper body with a volume of 1m3 increases through 1K then its volume will increase by 50.1  10-6 m3. The relations among α, β and γ are as follow: γ = 3α and β = 2α

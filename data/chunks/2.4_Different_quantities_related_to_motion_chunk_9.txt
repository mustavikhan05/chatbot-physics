v-u t âˆ´ rate of change of velocity, i.e. acceleration, a = v-u t Therefore, acceleration = change of velocity time Acceleration is a vector quantity. It has direction. Its direction is along the change of velocity. Since we are considering the motion along a straight line, change of direction of velocity will be either along the direction of velocity or opposite to the velocity. If the velocity increases than the change of velocity takes place along the velocity. In this case acceleration will be positive. If the velocity decreases then the change of velocity takes 36  Physics place opposite to the velocity. In this case acceleration will be negative and is called retardation or deceleration. Dimension : The dimension of acceleration is the dimension of  velocity / time  That is, acceleration = velocity  time

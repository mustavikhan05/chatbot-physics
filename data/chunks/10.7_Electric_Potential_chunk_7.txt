to be done. Potential difference: Let, in an electric field A and B are two points and the potentials of the points are VA and VB respectively (fig: 10.14). The work done in bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to point A is VA and to point B is VB. Therefore the work done in bringing a unit positive charge from point B to point A is VA -VB i.e. the potential difference between these two points. The work done in transferring a unit positive charge from one point to another point in an electric field is called potential difference between two points.

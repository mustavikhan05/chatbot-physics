passes from medium b to the medium a then according to the reversibility of ray of light (fig 9.5) CB will be the incident ray and BA will be the refracted ray, i.e. here the angle of incidence = r and the angle of refraction = i. Therefore the refractive index of medium a with respect to b will be [according to equation 9.1] bna = sin r sin i = 1 sin i / sin r = 1 anb (9.2) Bear in mind that the refractive index of medium a with respect to medium b is reciprocal of the refractive index of medium b with respect to medium a. bna = 1 anb and reversely anb = 1 bna  Again the refractive index can also be expressed in terms of velocity of light, anb =  And 0nb = velocity of light in medium b velocity of light in medium a velocity of light in medium b velocity of light in vacuum vacuum 146  Physics The medium whose refractive index is greater, density of that medium is greater and velocity of light is less in it. On the other hand, the medium whose refractive index is less, density of that medium is less and velocity of light is greater in it. Mathematical example 9.1:  When light refracts from air to water, the angle of incidence is 30° and angle of refraction is 19°. Find the refractive index of water with respect to air. We know, = n  anw  =            =                    =              =1.538  Ans: Refractive index 1.538 Mathematical example 9.2: The refractive index of water with respect to air is 1.33. What is the refractive index of air with respect to water? We know, wna = =                 = 0.75 Ans: 0.75

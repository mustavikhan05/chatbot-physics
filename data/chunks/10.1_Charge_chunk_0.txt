In a winter morning Sourov took his plastic comb to comb his hair. Before combing his hair he rubbed the comb with his woolen pullover for a while. While combing his hair he observed surprisingly that he cannot do it because all the hair was becoming straight and repels away each other. As soon as Sourov brings the comb close to the tale he observes the comb attracting some pieces of paper on the table. Some of you may have the same kind of experience like Sourov. In our daily life we observe that many objects around us behave like the comb of Sourov. Do it yourself: Rub your dry hair with your plastic scale for a while and hold it near some pieces of paper. We see that an object attracts another object in a special condition or becomes charged that is electricity produced in the object. Their charge remains static in the place of its production. So it is called static electricity. Now let us see what we mean by being charged. We know that each matter is consisted of small particles. The atom of every matter consists of electrons and which revolves around the nucleus. In the nucleus there are two type of particles-proton and neutron. The fundamental and special property of primary particles (electron and proton) of which the matter consist of is electrical property, which is determined by charge. The charges of electrons are negative and the charges of protons are considered to be positive. Neutron is electrically neutral that is it has no charge. The amount of charge in a proton is equal to the charge of an electron. Naturally an atom has an equal number of protons and electrons. As a result in the atom whole atom there is no electrical property to be detected. The number of electrons and protons in different matters is different. As long as the number of electron and proton are equal in any atom, it is electrically

force F act perpendicularly on area A of a surface, then pressure, P = F A i.e. Pressure = Force Area It is noted that less the area A, more is the pressure P and more the force F, more is the pressure P. (i)The area of the sharp edge of a nail is very small. So when the sharp end of the nail is placed on a wood like surface and hammered on the flat head of the nail, comparatively more pressure is exerted on the sharp end  as a result the nail easily enters into the substance. (ii)The area of the sharp edge of the knife is very small. So, by placing the sharp edge of the knife on a substance if force is applied, then more pressure acts on the substance along edge. Therefore the substance can easily be cut. Do it yourself: Hole a paper by a very sharp pin and by a blunt pin. Which one is easier to hole? Explain. More pressure is felt on the sharper edge of the pin when force is applied on its flat end. When force is applied on the flat end of the blunt pin, less pressure is exerted on the blunt end .So, it is easy to hole a paper by a sharper pin. Physics  89 Verify: Which one is more painful to walk bare footed on plain bricks soling road or a brick chucked road? Explain Unit of pressure: If we divide the unit of force by the unit of area, we get the unit of pressure. Therefore the unit of pressure is Nm-2. It is called pascal (Pa). âˆ´ 1Pa = 1Nm-2 If a force of 1N force is applied perpendicularly to an area of 1m2, then the pressure generated is known as 1Pa. Mathematical Example 5.1: The mass of a woman wearing a shoe is 50kg. The area of the bottom of the shoe is 200cm2. Find the pressure. We know. Pressure  P = F/A = W/A   =

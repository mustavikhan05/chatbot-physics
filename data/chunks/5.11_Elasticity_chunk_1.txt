the body due to its elastic property. This opposing force comes into play to resist the applied external force. This developed internal restoring force acting perpendicularly per unit area of the body is called strain. Hooke’s law: Scientist Robert Hooke invented the basic law of elasticity. According to this law- within elastic limit stress is directly proportional to strain. Mathematically we may write, stress ∝ strain ∴ stress = constant × strain. This constant is called the modulus of elasticity of the material of the body. Strain has no unit. The unit of stress is Nm-2. The unit of modulus of elasticity is also Nm-2.

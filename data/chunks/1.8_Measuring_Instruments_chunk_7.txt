connected with the vernier scale is to be pushed forward so that the jaws of the main scale and the vernier scale touch the opposite ends of the object. In some instrument reading not be coincided. Then have to understand there are some errors in the instruments and have to rectify it. The Screw Gauge This is device for the measurement of radius of wire of this cylinders and small length. It consists of a u-shaped still frame F (1.3). Fig 1.3 Screw Gauge The rod with plane end is permanently fixed with the plane surface A of one arm. The other arm has a hollow cylinder C. A linear scale graduated in millimeter is marked on the cylinder and a screw with a cylindrical cap T is fitted with it. The screw can moved through the hollow cylinder C. The end of the cylindrical cap T is graduated 0 to 50 or 100. When the Jaws are closed, that is, then the head of the screw B touches the plane end of the fixed rod A, the zero of the circular scale coincides with the zero of the linear scale. If the zero marks of the two scales do not coincide, then there is instrumental error. The distance through which the screw advances along the linear scale when the cap T is rotated once is called the Pitch of the screw gauge. The distance through which the screw advances when the circular scale is rotated through only 1 division is called the least count. The least count is obtained by dividing the pitch by the number of divisions in the circular scale. vernier mark has coincide with a main scale mark. Then the length of the rod will be L = 12mm + 7 x 0.1mm (here vernier constant is 0.1mm) = 12.7mm = 1.27cm. Physics

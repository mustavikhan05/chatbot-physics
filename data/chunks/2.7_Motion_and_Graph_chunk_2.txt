the line at point P. Now draw a perpendicular on Y-axis from P. This perpendicular meets at point N on Y- axis. Therefore, ON is the distance traveled in 32 minutes. The graph shows that the auto-rickshaw travels 16km in this time. Therefore, from graph we find any traveled distance S = PM for any time t = OM. ∴ Velocity = distance time = PM OM = ON OM , Here, PM OM is the slope of the OP. (B) In case of Non-uniform velocity : Fig 2.6 represents a distance-time graph of a body moving with non-uniform velocity. In this case the body does not move over equal distance in equal intervals of time, so the graph will not be a straight line. It will be a curved line. Since, the body is not moving with uniform velocity, its velocity will not be the same at all instants during its motion. Suppose, the velocity of the body at a particular instant indicated by the point P in the curved line, is to be determined. To determine the velocity at the point P, we will have to consider a very small right angled triangle ABC. Its hypotenuse AB is so small Do by yourself : Take a graph paper. Draw the distance-time graph on the graph paper using any convenient unit mentioned in the table above. Find the distance traveled and velocity of the auto-rickshaw in 32 minutes from the graph. What will be the distance traveled and velocity in 44 minutes. Physics  43 that it virtually consider with the curved line adjacent to point P. In other words we are considering a part of the curved line which is so small that it may be considered a straight line. Then the velocity at the point P = distant represented by AC time interval represented by BC or v =   AC BC But it is difficult to get correct result by measuring such a small triangle. So we draw a tangent ED at the point P and draw a greater triangle DEF similar to ABC. Now from the triangles ABC and DEF We get,  AC BC   = DF EF ∴ v = DF EF But,

The atmospheric pressure on the peak of Mount Everest is about 30% of the sea-level air pressure. For this reason respiration becomes difficult at such a high level. There is a possibility of bleeding from the nose at high altitude as atmospheric pressure is considerably low there. Nowadays normal pressure is kept inside a plane for the convenience of the passengers when it flies at a very high altitude and low pressure region. With the increase of height from the earthâ€™s surface the pressure of the atmosphere decreases. The change of pressure of the atmosphere with altitude is shown in the graph [Fig: 5.4].

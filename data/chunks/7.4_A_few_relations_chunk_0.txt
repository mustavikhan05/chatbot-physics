The relation between frequency and time period: We know that the number of complete vibrations of a vibrating particle in one second is called its frequency. Frequency is denoted by ƒ. Again the time period is the time of one complete vibration. If the time period is T, then in T second, the number of vibration is 1 Therefore, the number of vibration in one second is T 1  The number of vibration in 1 second is frequency. So, the frequency, ƒ= 1 T

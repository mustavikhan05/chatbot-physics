made of the same material. The area of cross section of wire S is bigger than the area of cross section of wire T. Larger the area of cross section of a wire, the lower its resistance. Law of cross section: The resistance of a conductor is inversely proportional to its cross sectional area when the length, material and temperature of the conductor remain the same. That is, R ‚àù 1 A , when temperature, material and L is constant (11.2)

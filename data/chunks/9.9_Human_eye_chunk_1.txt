black layer light is not reflected internally within the eye. 5. Iris: Just behind the cornea, there is an opaque diaphragm. It is called Iris. The colour of the Iris may vary from person to person. Usually the colour of Iris is black, light azure or deep brown. Iris regulates the amount of light falling on the eye lens. 6. Pupil: The hole at the centre of the Iris is called Pupil. Through this pupil, light enters the eyes. 7. Eye lens: It is the most important part of the eye. It is situated just behind the pupil. It is made of transparent organic substances. Its radius of curvature of the back side is greater than that of the front side. This lens is hooked in the eye ball by ciliary Given,  Focal length, f = +0.1m  Power, P =? f 1 +0.1 1 Figure: 9.20 154  Physics muscles and suspensor ligaments. Due to the contractions and suspension of these muscles and ligaments, the curvature of the lens changes. It ultimately changes the focal length. To see different objects of near and distance, we need to adjust our focal length. 8.

By now, we know that a physical quantity is a combination of one or more fundamental quantities. So, any physical quantities may be expressed as the product of one or more fundamental quantities of different powers. The power of fundamental quantities in a physical quantity is called its dimension. For example, Force =  mass × acceleration = mass × velocity time = mass × distance time  × 1 time = mass × distance time2 Now, if we take that the dimension of length as L, the dimension of mass as M and the dimension of time as T, then the dimension of force is ML/T2 or MLT-2 , that is, force 12  Physics has the dimension of mass (1) dimension of length (1) dimension of time (-2). (The equation to express the dimension of physical quantity is called the dimensional equation). Third bracket [ ] is used to indicate dimensions in any quantity. As for Except these above mentioned three physical quantities of length, mass and time others dimension of physical quantities are : The dimension of temperature as θ (Capital alphabet of Greek letter θ), the dimension of electric current as I, the dimension of luminous intensity as J and the dimension of amount of substance as N. We can verify the validity of any equation or formula by analyzing dimension. For S = ut + 1 2

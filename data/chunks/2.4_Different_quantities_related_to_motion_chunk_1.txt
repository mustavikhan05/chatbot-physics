surrounding in a definite direction is called displacement. The minimum distance, that is, the linear distance between the initial and final position of a body is the magnitude of its displacement at its direction is towards final position from the initial position. The displacement does not depend on the path of the object. An object can move from position A to position B following different paths. But its displacement will be from A Fig-2.2 Fig-2.3 W E S N 32 Physics towards B. The minimum distance between A and B, that is, in this case the linear distance AB is the magnitude of displacements. AB and its direction is towards B from A. Here, it is a vector quantity, since displacement has both magnitude and direction. The dimension of displacement is the same as that of distance. Therefore, [ s ] = L The unit of displacement is the same as that of distance that is meter (m). The displacement of a body is 50m towards north means that the body has moved 50m from its initial position towards north direction. Speed : Suppose in the previous example, Ovi takes 50 seconds, to travel 100m distance. If Mitu covers the same distance in 40 seconds, who goes faster ? Ovi or Mitu, definitely Mitu goes faster because she takes less time. Suppose, Ovi travels 100m in 50 seconds, Mitu travels 75m in 30 seconds can we say Ovi goes slower than Mitu ? Does not Ovi travel more distance than Mitu ? The distance of a particular time Ovi and Mitu travels has to be compared to know who goes faster. Let the particular time be 1 second therefore, In 1 second Ovi travels 100 50

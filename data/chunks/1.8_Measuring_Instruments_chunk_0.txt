Meter Scale : This simplest instrument to measure length in the laboratory is a meter scale. It’s length is 1 meter or 100 centimeters. This is why, it is called a meter scale. One side of this scale is graduated in centimeter and the other side in inches. Each centimeter is divided into ten equal parts. Each of this parts is called 1 millimeter or 0.1 centimeter. Each inch is divided into eight, ten or sixteen equal parts. Measure with a meter scale : To measure the length of a rod or a stick by the meter scale, it’s one end is so placed that is coincides with the 0 mark or some other convenient mark of the scale. The reading of the mark that coincides with the other end of the rod is taken. The difference between the readings at the two ends of the rod gives 14  Physics the length of the rod. In general if the reading of the mark that coincides with the left end of the rod is x and that of the mark coinciding with the right end is y. Then the length of the rod is L = y – x. With this scale length may be measured to an accuracy of 1 millimeter. For more accurate measurement vernier scales are used. Vernier scale : In the ordinary meter scale we can measured length up to 1 millimeter. To measure fractions of millimeter like 0.2mm, 0.6mm, 0.8mm etc. we have to use vernier scale. This scale was invented by a mathematician Pierea Vernier and is called vernier scale according to his name.

energy also depends on the velocity of objects. The more is the velocity the higher will be the kinetic energy. The damage will be less if a truck hits a wall with less velocity but the damage will be more in case of higher velocity. Mathematical Example 4.2: The kinetic energy of a runner of mass 70 kg is 1715 J. What is his velocity? We know, Ek = mv2 or, v2 = ∴ v = ( ) = ( )  = 7 ms-1 Ans:  7 ms-1 1 2 2Ek m 2Ek m 2 × 1715 J 70 kg Here, Mass, m = 70 kg Kinetic energy, Ek = 1715 J Velocity, v =? Physics  73

Fusion To transform a substance from solid to liquid by applying heat is called fusion. The definite temperature at which a solid starts to melt is called its melting point. This temperature remains unchanged until all of the substance melts. Vaporization The phenomenon of transformation of a liquid from its liquid state to gaseous state is called vaporization. This vaporization may occur in two processes- i) Evaporation ii) Boiling Evaporation The process in which a liquid at any temperature slowly changes from its free surface into vapor state is called evaporation. Activities: Take some water in a bowl and keep it at a corner of your room. Observe what happens to the water after one or two days. It will be observed that the water has been reduced. What is the cause for the reduction of this water? The water has been converted into vapor even at the room temperature and for this the amount of water has been lessened. This is called evaporation. Boiling The process in which a liquid is rapidly converted into vapor by increasing its temperature through application of heat is called boiling. The temperature at which boiling of liquid begins is called the boiling point of that liquid. The value of boiling point depends on pressure. Experiment: Pouring some water in a container and supplying heat the gradual increase of temperature would be observed. At a certain temperature the water will begin to boil and get converted into water vapor. It is called boiling. So, it is understood that liquid may be converted into its gaseous state at any temperature or at its boiling point. Condensation: The process of converting a gaseous substance from its gaseous state to liquid state by lowering the temperature is called condensation. Physics  109

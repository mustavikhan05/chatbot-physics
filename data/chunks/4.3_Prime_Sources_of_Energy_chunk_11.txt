tons of coal. But there are some problems of nuclear power plants. The waste of nuclear fuel is extremely radioactive and so it has to be preserved for thousands of years to make it safe. Moreover, in a nuclear reactor high temperature and pressure is produced. So it has to be made of such a material that can tolerate the high temperature and pressure. Any nuclear accident is very dangerous which we can realize from the accidents of Chernobyl Physics 79 in Soviet Union (at present Ukraine) and Fukushima in Japan. In nuclear power production less greenhouse gas is released in the environment. The Social Effects and Advantages of Renewable Energy Uses of renewable energy have a far-reaching effect on our social life. In comparison with the demand of our country the storage of coal, petroleum and natural gas is very poor. So, we have to import mineral oil and coal from abroad to meet up the demand of energy by spending a lot of valuable foreign currency. But utilizing the renewable energy sources that we have in our country especially if we can encourage the people to produce and use biogas, we will be able to change the infrastructure of rural area. We can focus our attention to electricity production using windmill.  If we can make the use of solar energy available through research, we will be able to meet up all our demands of energy from this unlimited source. The main advantage of using of renewable energy is that there is no possibility of diminishing of energy. Moreover it will be possible to protect our country from environment pollution.

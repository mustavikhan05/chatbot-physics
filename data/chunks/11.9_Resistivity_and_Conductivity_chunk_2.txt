(11.4) Substituting the units of the quantities on the right side of the equation, the unit of ρ is 2 m m m Ω = Ω 184 Physics Significance: The resistivity of silver at 20 °C is 1.6×10-8 Ω m. Therefore, the resistance of a silver wire of length 1m and cross sectional area of 1m2 is 1.6×10-8 Ω. Table shows the values of the resistivity of some common materials. Table 11.2 Resistivities of different materials Material Resistivity (Ω m) Silver 1.6×10-8 Copper 1.7×10-8 Tungsten 5.5×10-8 Nichrome 100×10-8 From the table above we see that the materials with lower resistivities are good conductors of electricity. For example- copper is much better conductor of electricity than nichrome. Due to this, copper is widely used as connecting wires in electrical circuits. Besides, materials with higher resistivities also have multiple uses. One example is the nichrome wire. The resistivity and melting point of nichrome is much higher than that of copper. Due to the high resistivity of nichrome, a lot of thermal energy is produced when a current flows through it. This property of nichrome causes water to boil very quickly in electric kettle. The filament of electric bulbs that are used in our houses is made of tungsten. Tungsten can convert electrical energy to light and thermal energy owing to its high resistivity and melting point. Conductivity The reciprocal quantity of resistance is called conductance. Like that, the reciprocal quantity of specific resistance is called conductivity. Conductivity is expressed by the letter σ. The value of σ depends on the type of material of the conductor and its temperature. Say, the specific

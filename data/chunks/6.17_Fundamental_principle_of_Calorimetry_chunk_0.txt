When two bodies of different temperatures are brought in thermal contact then reception and donation of heat take place. The body at higher temperature leaves heat whereas the body at lower temperature receives heat. This give and take will continue until they reach at the thermal equilibrium. If no heat is lost during donation and reception of heat, then the amount of heat given up by the body at higher temperature will be equal to the heat gained by the body at lower temperature. So, Heat lost = Heat gained … … … (6.9) It is called the principle of Calorimetry. Investigation no 6.1 Determination of melting point of ice Aim: To observe the melting of ice and to find the relation between temperature and melting point and to draw a graph. Apparatus: Celsius thermometer, ice, stand, burner, beaker, stopwatch. Working procedure: 1. After grinding some ice put them in a beaker. Heat Capacity mass 112  Physics 2. Carefully dip the thermometer in ice in such a way that the bulb remains in the ice but it does not come in contact with the wall of the beaker. 3. The temperature is to be recorded slowly after applying heat. 4. Take the reading of the temperature every after each minute until all the ice melts. 5. Following the above procedure continue to apply heat even after all the ice melts and the temperature becomes 20°C-25°C. Record the temperature every after each minute. 6.  Draw a temperature vs. time graph using the obtained data. 7. Find the melting point of ice from the graph. 8. Analyze the nature of the graph. Drawing of temperature vs. time graph.

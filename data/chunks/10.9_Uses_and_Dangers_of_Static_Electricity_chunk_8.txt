negatively charged and the far end positively. 10. If the far end of the conductor is connected to earth by a wire or if touched barefooted without displacing the glass rod, electron from the ground will neutralize the positive charges of the conductor. As a result, only the negative charges will remain in the conductor. 11. Now if the conductor is brought near a pith ball it will be attracted. 12. The conductor is charged by the process of induction. Exercise  A. Multiple Choice Questions Tick (√) the correct answer 1.

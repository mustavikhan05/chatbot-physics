Ultra sonography is a safer diagnosing method in comparison to X-ray. Yet, it is to be used for a very limited time. Besides, the transducer should always be kept in movement, so that it does not become static at any position. CT scan CT scan stands for Computed Tomography Scan. In medical science it is the process of creating image. Tomography is the process of generating a two-dimensional image of a slice or section through a 3-dimensional object. CT scanner is a large machine and uses X-rays. Where X-ray forms a two dimensional image of a three dimensional organ inside the body, there the image formed by CT scan machine is three dimensional. The CT scan machine uses digital geometry processing to generate a three dimensional of the inside of an object. The three dimensional image is made after many 2- Figure: 14.3 Ultrasonography Physics

work, energy, time, temperature etc are the examples of scalar quantities. Vector quantity : Physical quantity which need both magnitude and direction to be fully expressed are called vector quantities. Displacement, velocity, acceleration, force, electric intensity etc are the examples of vector quantities. Table 2.1 Shows that vectors are expressed by magnitude and direction whereas scalars are expressed by magnitude only. Table 2.1 Scalar Quantity Vector quantity Distance d 40m Displacement s 40m east direction Speed v 30ms-1 Velocity v 30 ms-1 north direction Time t 15s Force F 100N upward direction Energy E 2000j Acceleration a 98ms-2 downward direction

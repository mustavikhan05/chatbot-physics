Microphone is orally known as mike. In a big meeting or program, a speaker delivers his speech in front of an electronic device which is known as microphone or mike. Microphone converts sound into an electric signal. The audience can hear it loudly through a loud speaker. Because the speaker transforms the electric signal of microphone into sound. Perhaps you will have seen the use of microphone and speaker in various ceremonies of your school. Both microphones and speakers are found in tape-recorder, VCR etc. Microphone and its functions We have already said that microphone is such a device that changes sound wave into electrical audio wave or signal. The frequency and relative amplitude of the electrical audio signal remain the same as that of the sound wave. There is a moving coil and a thin metallic sheet named diaphragm in the microphone. When a person speaks through a microphone, the diaphragm vibrates by the sound wave. Diaphragm is that part of the microphone which is designed to transform the vibration of sound into electricity. The vibration of different types of sounds vibrates the diaphragm differently. This vibration makes the diaphragm move to and fro in the magnetic field. As a result, Fig: 13.6 Microphone 216

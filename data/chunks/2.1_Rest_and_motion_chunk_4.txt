at rest or in motion, we mean it is to be so with respect to a body apparently at rest. So we can say that in this universe all rest and all motion are relative. No rest or no motion is absolute. Mitu is waiting for a bus at the bus stand to go somewhere. She notices her friend Roni crossing her by rickshaw. She says that the rickshaw is in motion because it is changing its position continuously with respect to time. The change of position of a body may take place in two ways. Let us consider the following example : a) Mou is standing under a tree and sees that her friend Awishi is running away from her. So the distance between Mou and Awishi is increasing with time. b) A large circular tract is made in the school field of Raju for race of annual sports. He notices his friend Shihab practicing to running along that track standing at the centre of the trac (Fig 2.1 (b)). Raju says Shihab is in motion but the distance between them is not changing with time. How it can be said that Shihab is in motion with respect to Raju.

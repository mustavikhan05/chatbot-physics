happens because of refraction of light. The ray of light coming from O enters the rarer medium from denser medium. As a result the refracted ray goes away from the normal. If the refracted ray is extended backward it appears to come from O'. Here the point O' is the virtual image of the point O. If we look directly at the point O it seems to be raised at point O' (fig: 9.3). air glass air glass 144 Physics Laws of refraction of light: We have already noticed that in the fig: 9.1 (here fig: 9.4) AB is the incident ray, BC is the refracted ray and NBN′ is the normal drawn at B on PQ. ∠ABN is the angle of incidence i and ∠N′BC is the angle of refraction r. Now if the angle of incidence is increased the angle of refraction will also increase but the angle of refraction will not be proportional to the angle of incidence that is if the angle of incidence i is doubled the angle of refraction r will never be so. It is seen that if the angles of incidence are i1, i2, i3, ……. and their respective angles of refraction are r1, r2, r3, …. then, sin i1 sin r1  = sin i2 sin r2 = sin i3 sin r3 = constant The value of this constant depends upon the nature of media and the colour of the light used. Again it is seen that AB, BC and the normal NBN′ are on the plane of your book. From this observation we see that refraction of light follows the following two laws. First law: The incident ray, normal drawn at the point of incidence on the surface of separation and the refracted ray lie on the same plane. Second law: When light enters obliquely to a transparent medium from another transparent medium then for a fixed pair of media and for a fixed colour of light the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction always remains constant. This law is also known as Snell’s law.

the diseased or injured organ. The reflected part of light returns back through the second fiber optic tube in the same way. The reflected light enters the eyes of doctors through the eyepiece lens. As a result, the doctor can see what is happening inside the examined organ. Endoscopy allows doctors to check for any type of irritation, ulcer, inflammation and abnormal tissue growth in the internal organ. Endoscopy is used to examine a number of different organs, including: (A) the lungs, central partition of the chest; (B) the stomach, small intestine, large intestine or colon; (C) the female reproductive organ; (D) the abdomen and pelvis; (E) the inside of urinary bladder; (F) the nasal cavity and sinuses surrounding the nose; (G) the ears. Radiotherapy The word radiotherapy is the abbreviated form of the word ‘Radiation therapy’. Different diseases like cancer, abnormal nature of thyroid gland, some diseases concerning blood are treated using it. Generally radiotherapy destroys cancer cells utilizing highly energized X-ray. It destroys the power of multiplication of the cells by damaging the DNA inside the tumor cell. Mainly, it is the application of ionizing (radioactive) radiation in the treatment of disease. Radiotherapy is of two types: 1. External beam radiation or external radiotherapy 2. Internal radiotherapy In case of external radiotherapy highly energized X-ray, cobalt radiation, electron or proton beams are applied from outside the body. The beam is applied directing to that site of the body where the tumor is located. As a result, the growth and power of multiplication of the cancer cells get destroyed. In this process a very few number of healthy cells also get affected. Yet, our aim is to destroy cancer cells as many as possible than the healthy cells. Most of the healthy cells that got damaged can repair themselves.

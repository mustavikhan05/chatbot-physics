Rimi is pushing the wall strongly. As work is said to be done only when a force is acted on a body and displaces it, so in the above examples (b) and (c) work is done but in the example (a) and (d) no work is done. We can apply force to shift a body from one place to another. We can change the shape of any body by applying force. In these cases work is done. If a construction laborer wants to get to the second floor of a building with ten bricks, he has to do more work than that of lifting a single brick to the same place as he has to use more force. He has to do more work if he wants to lift those brick on the third floor. Therefore, the amount of work depends on the applied force and the distance. Work is measured by the product of applied force on a body and its displacement along the direction of force. Therefore, Work = Force × Distance travelled along the direction of force If a force F is applied on a body and the body travels a distance s along the direction of force (fig: 4.1) then the work done (W) will be, W= Fs… … … (4.1) Work has no direction. It is a scalar quantity. Dimension of Work: Dimension of work will be the dimension of force × dimension of displacement Figure: 4.1 70

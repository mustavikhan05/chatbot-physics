A fluid is a substance which flows or is capable of flowing. Fluids are of two types - liquids and gases. Pressure of a fluid: The force exerted perpendicularly by a fluid at rest on unit area of a surface is called pressure. If the area of the surface is A and the force applied perpendicularly by the fluid is F, then pressure p = F/A. Buoyancy: A water filled pitcher is easy to move in water but it is not that much easy to move keeping it out of water. The pitcher is felt considerably lighter in immersed condition as upward thrust acts on it. Therefore, the thrust acting vertically upward is equal to the weight of equal volume of water displaced by the submersed body. For this reason an immersed body apparently losses its weight. Magnitude of buoyancy: Every point of a body immersed in a fluid will experience thrust in all directions. Let a cylinder PQRS is of cross-sectional area A and height h. It is submersed in a fluid of density ρ. The depth of the upper and lower surface of the cylinder from the free surface of the fluid are h1 and h2 respectively. So, h = h2 – h1 The downward force acting on the surface PQ of the cylinder, F1 = Ah1ρg The upward thrust exerted by the liquid on the surface SR of the cylinder, F2 = Ah2ρg The lateral pressures experienced by the curved surface of the cylinder being equal and opposite of each other it become neutralized. ∴ Upward thrust or buoyancy = F2 – F1 = Ah2ρg – Ah1ρg = A (h2 – h1) ρg = Ahρg. =

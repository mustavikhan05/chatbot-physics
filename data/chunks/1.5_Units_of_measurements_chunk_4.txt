Unit of length : Meter : The distance traveled by light in vacuum (air-free space) in 1 299792458 Unit of mass : Kilogram : The kilogram is the mass equal to that of a cylinder made of platinum-iridium alloy (International prototype kilogram) kept at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures at Severs, France. The diameter of this cylinder is 3.9 cm ; its height is also 3.9 cm. Unit of time : Second :The time required to complete 9 192 631 770 vibrations by a caesium-133 atom is called one second (s). Unit of temperature : Kelvin : The temperature which equals to 1 273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water is called one Kelvin (k). Unit of electric current : Ampere : The ampere is that current which produces a force of 2x10-7 Newton per meter in vacuum between two parallel infinitely long conductors of negligible cross-sectional area 1 meter apart when each conductor carries the same current. Unit of luminous intensity: Candela : Candela

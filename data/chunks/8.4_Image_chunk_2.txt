screen but the virtual images cannot be displayed in a screen. Images are of two types- (A) Real image (B) Virtual image (A)Real image: If light rays emitted from a point after being reflected or refracted on a surface actually converge at a second point, then this second point is called the real image of the first point. In figure 8.10, I is the real image due to reflection. (B) Virtual image: If light rays emitted from a point after being reflected or refracted on a surface seem to diverge from a second point, then this second point is called the virtual image of the first point. In figure 8.11, I is the virtual image due to reflection.

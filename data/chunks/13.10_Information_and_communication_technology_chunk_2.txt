signal. After that the sound wave is separated from the carrier wave by the process of demodulation. Later electrical signal is amplified with the help of amplifier and is sent to loudspeaker. Loudspeaker again changes the electrical signal into sound. We can hear this sound. So, the sound is not transmitted from the transmitter to the radio. The sound wave is sent by changing it into electromagnetic wave, the receiver receives the radio wave, the loudspeaker changes it into sound. Figure: 13.9 Television: Television is such a device by which we can hear the sound and watch the picture of the speakers on the screen from distant place. In 1926, Logy Beard was able to send pictures on television. On that day, the TV actor was a talking doll.  Figure: 13.10 218  Physics How television works: We know that we can see picture on television along with hearing sound. To send the sound and picture on television, there are separate transmitters in the transmitting station by which sound and picture can be sent in the form of electromagnetic wave.  Figure: 13.10 Pictures are transformed into electrical signals and then sent with the help of one of the transmitters. With the help of another transmitter pictures are transformed into electrical signals and then transmitted them in the form of electromagnetic wave. At first we should discuss about sending and receiving picture.  The pictures or the scenery

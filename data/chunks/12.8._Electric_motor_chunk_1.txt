to A and B respectively. The outer part of the separated segment makes a contact with the electric source through carbon brush. The segment moves with the coil and when its’ gap between two side remains opposite to the carbon brush, no current will flow. But despite this fact, the movement will remain continue for its inertia and it will get force newly when it will come to the contact of the moving brush. Thus the rotation will remain continue. Figure:12.8 a, Figure: 12.8 b It is noticeable that though A and B have changed their position, the comutator  current will enter from the right side of the loop like before and will come out from the left, (see the figure 12.9) and the coil will rotate clockwise. This is the principle of electric motor. Electric motor converted the electric energy into mechanical energy. To increase the speed and power of it, the intensity pf the magnetic field will have to increase. The intensity of the of the magnetic field can be increased in many ways. These are – -By increasing the electric current.  -By increasing the number of turn in the loop or coil. -By using powerful magnet. -By increasing length and width of the coil. The electric motor that we use also works in the same way. But extra parts will have to add to increase the power and flexibility of the rotation. Many coils or loops are made instead of only one coil or loop and they are arranged neatly around the central axis or orbit. Each of these wires is connected to its commutator. It helps to move continuously and easily. Each of coils is made of hundred scrape on the soft rod of iron (which is called armature).For this, the armature is magnetized during current flow and increase the intensity of the magnetic field. (In figure 12.10, two broken lines of three armatures have been shown).The rotation can be increased by bending two sides of the magnet.

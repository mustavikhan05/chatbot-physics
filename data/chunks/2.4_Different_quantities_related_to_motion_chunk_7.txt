time or changes its direction of motion while moving then its velocity will be variable. Usually we moving, car runs on the road etc. are the uniform velocity. Acceleration and Retardation : If a body does not move with uniform velocity then the magnitude or direction or both of the velocity may change. We say that there is acceleration of a body if its velocity changes. Suppose a car is moving along a straight Fig-2.4 N S W E Physics 35 road. Mitu sitting in the car recorded the readings of speedometer of the car after every 8 seconds. The velocity of the car at different time in the units kmh-1 and ms-1 are shown in the following table. Table 2.2 Velocity-Time table Serial No Time (s) Velocity (kmh-1) Velocity (ms-1) 1. 0 0 0 2. 8 14.4 4 3. 16 28.8 8 4. 24 43.2 12 5. 32 57.6 16 6. 40 72.0 20 From this table we can see that the velocity of the car increases from 0 to 4ms-1 in first 8 second. In the next 8 seconds the velocity of the car increases by 4ms-1. In the way the velocity of the car increases by 4ms-1 in every 8 seconds. In other words the change of velocity of the car is 0.5ms-1. So, the rate of change of velocity of the car with time is 0.5ms-1. The rate of change of velocity with time that is the change of velocity in unit time is known as acceleration. The rate of increase of velocity with time of a body moving in a straight line is called positive acceleration and the rate of decrease of velocity of a body with time is called negative acceleration. Sometimes negative acceleration is called retardation or deceleration. The rate of change of non-uniform velocity of a body with time is called its acceleration. If the initial velocity of a body is u and its final velocity after time t is v. then change of velocity in time t = v â€“ u Hence, change of velocity in unit time =

kettle. The filament of electric bulbs that are used in our houses is made of tungsten. Tungsten can convert electrical energy to light and thermal energy owing to its high resistivity and melting point. Conductivity The reciprocal quantity of resistance is called conductance. Like that, the reciprocal quantity of specific resistance is called conductivity. Conductivity is expressed by the letter σ. The value of σ depends on the type of material of the conductor and its temperature. Say, the specific resistance of the material of a conductor = ρ Therefore, the conductivity of its material is 1 σ ρ =

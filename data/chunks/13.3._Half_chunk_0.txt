We canâ€™t say which atom of a radioactive element will decay and when it will take place. But we can calculate how many atoms will decay in a particular time. A cluster of atoms is considered to study the decay of atoms. The time during which just half of the total number of radioactive atoms undergoes disintegration is called the half-life of that element. As for example, let us assume that there are 800000 atoms in a radioactive element. The time required for the decay of its half i.e. 400000 atoms to transform into a new element is known as its half-life. After a next half-life, there remains 200000 numbers of atoms. After another half-life, the number of atoms will be 100000 and thus it will continue. Here a law of possibility works, which atom will disintegrate when, none can say it. 13.4: Uses of radioactivity There are a lot of uses of radioactivity in medical science, agriculture and industries. In medical science especially to treat incurable cancer, the uses of radioactivity are frequent now-a-days. In medical science, the radioactive isotopes are used as radioactive tracers to diagnose different diseases like blockage of kidney, thyroid problems etc. In agriculture, radioactive tracers are being successfully used, especially to develop high yielding variety of seeds and in the research to produce special type of fertilizer necessary for trees. The radioactivity is also widely used in industries. To make the equipment germless, to control the thickness of paper in the paper mill, to identify the presence of smoke in the fire, to verify the welding of metals, the radioactivity is being successfully used. It is also used to measure the quantity of different elements

Evaporation depends on the following factors: Flow of air: The speed of evaporation increases if the air flows faster over the liquid. The area of the exposed surface of the liquid: Evaporation increases as the area of the exposed surface of the liquid increases. Nature of liquid: The rates of evaporation of different liquids are different. Less the boiling point of a liquid, more would be the rate of evaporation. The rate of evaporation of volatile substances is maximum. Pressure on the liquid: The rate of evaporation decreases with the increase of atmospheric pressure on the liquid. The rate of evaporation increases with the decrease of pressure. The rate of evaporation in vacuum is maximum. Liquid and the temperature of the air in contact with the liquid: If the temperature of the air in contact with the liquid increases then the rate of evaporation will increase. Effect of dryness: The more the dryness of the air over the liquid surface i.e. the less the amount of water vapor in the air more will be the rate of evaporation. The soaked cloths dry up quickly in winter because air remains dry at that time.

infinity to a point in an electric field is called the potential of that point. Again from infinity if a unit of positive charge is brought near to the conductor, the work done by the electric force or against the electric force is called potential of that conductor. If a unit positive charge q is brought very near to the conductor from a point at infinity and if the amount of work done is W, the potential ‘V’ of the conductor or of that point

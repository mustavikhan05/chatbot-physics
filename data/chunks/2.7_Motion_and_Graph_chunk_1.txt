will discuss the motion of an object moving only along straight line to avoid the complexities. So the velocity changes only for its magnitude. (A) In case of uniform Velocity: Suppose a pollution free CNG run auto-rickshaw is moving along plane straight road. The table below shows the distances traveled after every 12 minutes. 42 Physics Distance – Time table Time, t (min) Distance s km 0 0 12 6 24 12 36 18 48 24 60 30 Table 2.3 Figure 2.5 For above mentioned motion in the table a distance-time graph shown in fig 2.5. Suppose from the graph we have to find the traveled distance in 32 minute by the auto- rickshaw; we have to mark a point (M) to indicate time, 32 minute on X-axis. Then we have to draw a line parallel to Y-axis from that point on the graph. Let the line at point P. Now draw a perpendicular on Y-axis from P. This perpendicular meets at point N on Y- axis. Therefore, ON is the distance traveled in 32 minutes. The graph shows that the auto-rickshaw travels 16km in this time. Therefore, from graph we find any traveled distance S = PM for any time t = OM. ∴ Velocity = distance time     = PM OM    = ON OM , Here,  PM OM is the slope of the OP.

Can you stand on a single leg easily that you can do by using your two legs? The shoes pierce into the mud when one walks on soft mud wearing a high hill. But if one does so wearing a flat pair of shoes, then it does not get into the mud. We will see that it happens due to the change of pressure.  Fig-5.1 The force exerted perpendicularly to unit are of a body is called pressure. Let a force F act perpendicularly on area A of a surface, then pressure, P = F A  i.e.   Pressure = Force Area It is noted that less the area A, more is the pressure P and more the force F, more is the pressure P. (i)The area of the sharp edge of a nail is very small. So when the sharp end of the nail is placed on a wood like surface and hammered on the flat head of the nail,

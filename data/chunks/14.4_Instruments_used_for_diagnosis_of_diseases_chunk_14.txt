in the liquid. This process is called brachytherapy. ETT ETT is the short form of ‘Exercise Tolerance Test’. It is a test of the stimulated heart. Electric activities or functions (rate or rhythm) of the heart during exercise are recorded by ETT. In fact, it is an ECG test of the patient while doing exercise. This test is very important for identifying the diseases related to coronary artery. During this test, extra stress of exercise is imposed on the heart. Figure 14.9: ETT test Partial blockage developed in the coronary arteries of heart is identified by this test. Generally, this type of abnormal condition in patient’s body cannot be identified while taking rest. During the test, the patient is instructed to ride a stationary bicycle or to walk continuously on a treadmill machine. The physician records the ECG of the patient during exercise. By adjusting the speed of rotation of the wheel and slope of the surface, the degree of stress is gradually increased. Physicians become able to identify the changes that occur in the patient’s heart during exercise through ETT. Angiography Angiography is such an imaging test where X-ray is used to view the blood vessels of the body. This test is used to study whether the arteries or veins are narrow, blocked or enlarged in the body. The normal flow of blood is obstructed in the body when the blood vessels are blocked and they are narrow or not wide. During angiogram the physicians inject a liquid through a thin and flexible tube into the patient’s body. The liquid is called ‘dye’ and the tube is called ‘catheter’. The blood vessels become visible on an X- ray due to the use of dye. This dye is later eliminated from the body through kidneys and urine. Through a definite entry point the catheter is introduced into a definite artery or vein. The entry point may be in any blood vessel of the body. Sometimes, the ‘dye’ used is also termed as ‘contrast’. 238  Physics

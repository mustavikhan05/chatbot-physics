= mgh ∴ Ep = mgh (4.3) i.e. potential energy = mass of the body × acceleration due to gravity × vertical height Potential energy depends on the vertical height of the object from the surface of the earth. The more is the height, the higher will be the potential energy. Potential energy also depends on the mass of the object. The more the mass the more will be the potential energy of the object. To use the potential energy stored in a body it is necessary to transform it into other form of energy. For example, a piece of stone is not dangerous as long as it is on the roof and its potential energy transforms into kinetic energy i.e. it starts to fall. Mathematical Example 4.3: What will be the potential energy of a body of mass 6kg if it is raised to a height of 20m above the surface of the earth? g = 9.8 ms-2. We know, Ep = mgh = 6kg × 9.8 ms-2 × 20m = 1176 J Ans: 1176 J

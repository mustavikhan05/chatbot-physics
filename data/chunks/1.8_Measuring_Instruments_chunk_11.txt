Fig 1.4 then the diameter of the wire = 3mm + 20 x 0.01mm = 3mm + 0.2mm = 3.2mm 18 Physics The balance has two scales pans P1 and P2 of equal weight at the two ends like an ordinary balance. The scale pans are hanged from the ends of a metal beam AB with the help of two frames of equal weight. The frames are placed on two inverted knife edges in two grooves at the end. A knife with its edges downward, is fixed in the middle of the beam AB. It is placed on a hollow vertical pillar. The pillar is firmly fixed at the middle of a wooden floor CC. Three leveling screws LS are fixed with this floor (the third has not been shown in the fig.). These are used to level the instrument. A solid metal rod inside the hollow pillar can be raised or lowered with the help of a level H connected with the floor. The base of triangular shaped agate is fixed exactly in the middle of the beam AB. The sharp age is kept on an agate plate placed on the solid rod of the beam. When the solid rod is lifted, the beam AB swings about the narrow edge of the agate as the fulcrum. The broad side of a long pointer (PO) is fixed at the middle of the balance. Itâ€™s lower narrow end is free to move over a scale. When the beam is horizontal, the pointed end of the pointer rests on the zero of the scale. The beam is made horizontal with the help of a plumb-line (PL) and the leveling screws. The entire instrument is kept in a glass box. Measurement by Balance : To use the balance, the handle H is rotated to left the pillar and hence the beam AB .The beam will then start swing freely about the knife edge. Along with the beam the scale pans will also keep in swinging up and down, with the backward rotation of the handle H.

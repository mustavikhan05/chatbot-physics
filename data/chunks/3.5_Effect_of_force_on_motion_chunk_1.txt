observed that the ball moves faster after the hit. In this case the acceleration is positive and its velocity increases. The velocity of a moving marble increases if it is stroked in same direction as it moves. A force can cause a moving object to decrease speed. Think you are riding a bicycle in the village road. After a while you observed that the road is slanting downwards. Now what will you do? Will you continue the pedaling as Physics 55 before or give a brake? You have to apply brake to cross this sloping road safely. Due to this, the cycle decelerates. A force can cause a moving object to change its velocity or direction of motion. A batsman hits the cricket ball coming from opposite direction during a game of cricket. Due to the hit, the magnitude and direction of the velocity of the ball change. The ball moves in a different direction due to this hit by the bat. In this case too, the ball has acceleration. Effect of forces on shape There are many examples around us where the shape of a body changes by the application of force. The shape of an empty plastic bottle changes when it is pressed. Again when a rubber band is stretched by pulling it, it becomes narrow and its shape changes. Sometimes, the changes of shape of the bodies are temporary in nature. Sometimes, the shape of the object is permanently changed due to the application of force. Such changes occur in the crushed metallic can or a car after a collision. A temporary change of shape may provide a useful way of absorbing and storing energy. Compressing the spring by rotation of the key the potential energy is stored in a toy car. When the car is released the potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy. A permanent change of shape may mean the failure of a structure- as a bridge collapse due to excess load.

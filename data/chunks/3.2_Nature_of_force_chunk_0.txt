Contact force: We are familiar with different types of force in our daily lives. Nature of them is of different types. Some of them are produced due to direct contact between two bodies.  In addition, there are some forces which do not need direct contact between two bodies. The force which needs direct contact between two bodies to be created is defined as contact force. When we push or pull a body with hand our hand exerts a force on the body at that time. This push or pull force is contact force. Since this force is the consequence of the direct contact between the hand and the body. The examples of contact forces are- frictional force, pulling force and the force created during collision. When a body tends to move or move over another body, then a resistive frictional force is produced against the motion between the contact surfaces of two bodies. Here the frictional force is produced due to direct contact between the surfaces of the two bodies. We apply pulling force on a box when we pull it over the floor. At that time frictional force is produced opposite to the motion of the box. Non-Contact force: The force which acts without direct contact between two bodies is called non-contact force. The attractive gravitational force between two bodies, the attractive or repulsive electric force between two charged bodies, the attractive or repulsive force between two poles of two magnets, the force of attraction acting between a magnet and a magnetic material are the examples of non-contact force or distant force. Do yourself:  Release a pen or pencil or any object from your hand. The body will fall down. Something is pulling the body downward certainly. Who is pulling?

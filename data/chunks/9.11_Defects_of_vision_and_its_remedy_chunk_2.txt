power of convergence of the eye lens. To remedy this defect, we need to decrease the power of convergence of the eye lens. For doing this, concave lens is used as aid lens or as spectacles. Besides, only a concave lens can create a virtual, erect and diminished image at a position nearer than that of the object. Therefore, to rectify short sight, a concave lens or spectacles should be used as aid lens in front of the eye. They should have such focal length or power so that due to refraction through the image of an object placed at infinity the image is formed at the far point of the defective eye [ fig 9.22 c]. We know that when the object is at infinity its virtual image is formed at the principal focus of the concave lens. Therefore, the focal length of the concave lens used as spectacles should be equal to the distance of the far point of the defective eye. 2. Long sight or hypermetropia: If any eye has this type of defect, it can see distant objects distinctly but cannot see near objects distinctly. Effect of such problem: In such a case, rays coming from the object placed at the near point of a normal eye, after refraction through the eye lens converge to a point I behind the retina [Fig. 9.23 (a)]. As a result, the image becomes blurred. The near point N of such an eye shifts away to O, which is more than 25 cm (the distance of the near point for a normal eye). Therefore, such a defective eye cannot see any objects distinctly, which is placed nearer to O [Fig 9.23 (b)].

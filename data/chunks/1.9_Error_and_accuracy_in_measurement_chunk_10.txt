number of divisions of the circular scale are noted. 2. Then the pitch is determined. When the circular scale takes one full turn, the length covered in the linear scale is called the pitch of the instrument. Least count (LC) is determined dividing the pitch by the total number divisions of the circular scale. 3. The wire under experiment is placed between the two ends and the screw is turned in the same direction to touch the wire lightly. 4. In this position the reading of the last mark of linear scale which is seen on the left side of the circular scale is taken. This reading of the linear scale is L. Then one should see which mark of the circular scale coincides with the mark of the linear scale. Physics  23 5.  In this ways at least 5 readings should be taken and they are placed in the table. 6.  After finding out the diameter, the area of the cross section of the wire is determined by using the formula (i) Table of investigation Findings : a) Determination of least Count : The value of one division of linear scale, S = ........mm Total division number of the circular scale, n = .........

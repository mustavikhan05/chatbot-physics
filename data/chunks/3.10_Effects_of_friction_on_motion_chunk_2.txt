time of vehicle movement. That is, we have to control the motion of a vehicle. Brake is such an arrangement, which controls the speed of the car or rotation of the wheels according to the necessity by increasing the friction. With this it is possible to halt a vehicle in a certain place. When the driver applies the brakes, the shoe or pad made of asbestos press the metallic disc on the wheel. The friction between the pad and disc slows down the wheelâ€™s speed. As a result, the velocity of a car decreases.

the concave lens can diverge a beam of parallel rays the more is its power. That is the shorter the focal length of a lens, the greater is its power. In general we can say that the capacity of a lens to convert a parallel beam of light into a convergent beam or into a divergent beam is called the power of the lens. There is a relation between the power P and focal length f. That is, P = . The power of a lens of focal length one meter is called one diapter (d). The power of spectacle that the eye specialists recommend is written in diapter unit. f 1 Physics  153 Sign convention: All distances are to be measured starting from the optical centre of the lens. All real distances are positive and real distances means the distance actually covered by the ray of light. SO, distance of real object, distance of real image and distance of real focus are all taken to be positive. All virtual distances are negative. Distance of virtual object, distance of virtual image and distance of virtual focus are all taken to be virtual distance. Focal length of convex lens is positive and focal length of concave lens is negative. Mathematical example 9.3: If the focal length of a lens is +0.1m then what is the power of the lens? We know, P =           = = 10D Ans: 10D

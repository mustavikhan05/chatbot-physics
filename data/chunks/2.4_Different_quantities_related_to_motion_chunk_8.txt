called positive acceleration and the rate of decrease of velocity of a body with time is called negative acceleration. Sometimes negative acceleration is called retardation or deceleration. The rate of change of non-uniform velocity of a body with time is called its acceleration. If the initial velocity of a body is u and its final velocity after time t is v. then change of velocity in time t = v – u Hence, change of velocity in unit time = v-u t ∴ rate of change of velocity, i.e. acceleration, a = v-u t Therefore, acceleration = change of velocity time

the body having less temperature will gain heat. The name of the apparatus used to measure the temperature is called thermometer. Fig: 6.1 Fig: 6.2 102 Physics Unit of temperature: In SI system the unit of temperature is Kelvin (K). Kelvin: The particular temperature and pressure at which water remains at its three states- solid, liquid and gas, is called the triple point of water. The temperature of the triple point of water is considered as 273 K. 1 273.16 th part of the temperature of the triple point of water is called 1K.

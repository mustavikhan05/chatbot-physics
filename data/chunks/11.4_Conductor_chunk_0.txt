We know, electric current is the flow of charges through a material. This electric current can move very easily through some substance. There are some mediums through which electricity cannot move at all. Solid materials are classified into three groups depending on their electricity conduction. For example: (1) conductor (2) insulator (3) semiconductor. 1. Conductor: The materials through which electric current can flow very easily are called conductors. Electrons can flow freely within these materials. In metal wires the charges are carried by electrons. So, the metallic materials are good conductors of electricity. Copper, silver, aluminium etc. are good conductors. Due to this reason, metallic wires are used as electric connectors. 2. Insulator: The materials through which electric current cannot flow are called insulators. Therefore, the materials where electrons are not free to move about are the Device Symbol Switch  Cell  Battery  Fixed resistor  Variable resistor  Fuse  Ammeter  Voltmeter  Galvanometer  Earth connector  Wires crossed  Wires not connected  Bulb or  Physics

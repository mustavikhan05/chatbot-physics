principal focus F along the path RFP1. Another ray PO from P passes through the optical centre O and is refracted along the path OP1. The refracted rays RFP1 and OP1 meet at point P1. So, P1 is the real image of point P. From point P1 a perpendicular P1Q1 is drawn on the principal axis. So, P1Q1 is the real image of PQ. Here OQ is the distance of object and OQ1 is the distance of image [figure 9.16]. Figure: 9.16 In this case the image is real, inverted and magnified. Depending on the position of the object on the principal axis the nature of image may be real, virtual, erect, inverted, magnified, diminished or equal in size to the object. If the position of the object is between the focus and optical centre the image will be virtual, erect and magnified. Image of an extended object Concave Lens: Suppose LOL1 is a concave lens. FOFâ€² is its principal axis, O is its optical centre and F is its principal focus. An extended object PQ is placed perpendicularly on the principal axis in front of the lens [fig: 9.17].The image of the object PQ is to be drawn.  Figure: 9.17 A ray of light PR emitted from P parallel to the principal axis incidents at R and is refracted along RM in such a way that it appears that the ray is coming from principal focus F. Another ray PO from P passes through the optical centre O` and refracts straight along PON. These two refracted rays are divergent so they do not meet. If they are extended in the backward direction then it appears that they are coming from the point P1. Now if we draw a perpendicular P1Q1 on the principal axis from P1 then P1Q1 will be M 152

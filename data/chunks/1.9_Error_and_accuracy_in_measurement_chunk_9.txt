A = L x B = ..........cm2 = ........... x 10-4cm2 and volume of the rectangular body V = L x B x H = ............cm2 = 10-6cm3 Investigation:1.2 Determine the area of cross section of a circular wire. Objective : Determination of the diameter of the wire by using screw gauge. Theory : Area of any substance is its surface area. If any wire is cut at right-angle with the length, then the surface obtained is the area of cross section of the wire. If the area of circular cross section of a wire is A then A = πr2, Here r = Radius of the wire π = 3.14 (22/7) a constant If the diameter of the wire is d, then r = d/2 So, A = π (d/2)2 = 1/4πd2................... (i) The reading of any length with the help of screw gauge = Linear scale reading (L) + number of divisions in the circular scale (C) x Least count (LC) That is, d = L + C x LC...................... (ii) Apparatus : Screw gauge, wire Procedure : 1.  At first the value of the smallest divisions of linear scale and the total number of divisions of the circular scale are noted. 2.  Then the pitch is determined. When the circular scale takes one full turn, the length covered in the linear scale is called the pitch of the instrument. Least count (LC) is determined dividing the pitch by the total number divisions of the circular scale. 3.  The wire under experiment is placed between the two ends and the screw is turned in the same direction to touch the wire lightly. 4.

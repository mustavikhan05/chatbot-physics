Write a report on why we should study physics. 2. Wonderful advancement took place in the twentieth century- put logic with example in favour of this. 3. a) What do you mean by quantity ? b) Write down the difference between fundamental and derived quantities. 4. a) In SI unit which quantities are considered as fundamental quantities ? b) Write down the name of units of these quantities. 5. What do you mean by dimension? 26 Physics Chapter Two MOTION [The object, that we see around us either are stationery or in motion. What do we actually understand by the words ``rest’’ and ``motion’’. We need different quantities regarding motion to express the characteristics of motion of a moving object. In this chapter we will discuss different quantities regarding motion, their dimensions, units, the relations among them etc.] By the end of this chapter we will be able to- 1. Explain the rest and motion 2. Find out the difference among different types of motion. 3. Explain the scalar and vector quantities 4. Analyze the relation among the quantities regarding motion 5. Explain the motion of freely falling bodies 6. Analyze the relations among the quantities regarding motion with the help of graph 7. Realize the effect of motion in our life Physics  27

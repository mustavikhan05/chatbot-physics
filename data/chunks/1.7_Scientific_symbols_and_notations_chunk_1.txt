For example “2.21 Kg’’, “7.3 x 102 m2’’, “22 k’’. The sign of % also follows the same rule. However Physics 13 space after number is not used to express the unit of angle i.e. degree, minute, and second ( ° , ` and " ). 2. Derived unit produced by multiplication is expressed using a space between two units e.g. N m. 3. Derived unit produced by division is expressed as negative power e.g. meter/second is expressed as ms-1 . 4. No punctuation mark or full stop is used with the notations as – they are not the abbreviated from any thing but the form of mathematical expression. 5. The symbol of unit is written in Roman type font, for example m for meter, s for second but the symbol of quantities are written in italic type font, for example, m for mass, s for displacement etc. It does not matter what kind of language or font is used after of before of these symbols and units to express. 6. The symbols of unit are expressed in small letters, for example “m’’, “s’’, “mol’’, but capital letters are used to write the unit which is derived from name of a person, for while expressing full form of unit small letters are used. For example, newton or pascal. 7. As prefix of a unit is the part of it, no space is used to express its symbol. For than one prefix is not allowed to use such as µµF, but pF. 8. Prefixes more than kilo (103) must be in capital letter. 9. The symbols of units are always singular. Such as ``25 kg’’ instead of ``25 kgs’’. 10. Line-break should be avoided for expressing any number or compound unit or number and unit. Only for important purposes line-break may be acceptable.

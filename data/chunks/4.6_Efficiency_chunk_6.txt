d) 50 m Answer the question 4 and 5 according to the following graph. 4. At which part of the graph velocity increases in proportion to time? a) part OA b) part AB c) part CD d) part DE mass of car 86 Physics 5. What is the maximum kinetic energy? a) 1.25 x 105 J b) 5 x 104 J c) 1.25 x 104 J d) 6.2 x 103 J 6.  From the law of conservation of energy it is found-  i) Energy cannot be created or destroyed. The total energy of the universe is constant and unchangeable.  ii) Non renewable energy will be finished quickly, so renewable energy has to be used  iii) We have to use energy effectively and reduce system loss in order to save energy. Which one is correct?  a) i b) ii c) iii d) i. ii and iii Creative Question: 1.  A boy of mass 40kg and a young man of mass 60kg start running from the ground floor and reach the roof at the same time. Both of them ran with the same velocity of 30m/min.  a) What is power?  b) What do you mean by the work 50J?  c) Find the kinetic energy of the young man.  d) Explain with mathematical logic whether the power of both are equal or not. General Question: 1.  A match stick is rubbed with its box with a force of 5N. The stick is dragged 5cm.  a) What is the energy used in rubbing?  b) What is the power needed if it takes 0.5s to drag the stick? 2.  The reservoir of a hydro-electric project is 800m high from the sea level and the power station is 250m high. The water of reservoir rotates a turbine coming through the pipe. There is 20 x 108 liter water in the reservoir. If the mass of 1 liter water is 1kg find the potential energy stored in the water of the reservoir. 3.

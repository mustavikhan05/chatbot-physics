ut + 1 at2 2 = 15ms-1 x 5s + 1 × 4ms-2 2 (5s)2 = 75m + 50m = 125m Ans : Final velocity v = 35ms-1 Traveled distance s = 125m Mathematical Example 2.5 : A car starting from rest in straight moves with uniform acceleration of 10ms-2. What will be the velocity while crossing a person at a distance 80m ? Solution : Here, We know Initial velocity u = 0 v2 = u2 + 2as Acceleration a = 10ms-2 = 0 + 2 x 10ms-2 x 80m Traveled distance s = 80m = 1600m2s-2 Final velocity      v = ? taking root both the sides, v = 40ms-1  ∴ Ans : 40ms-1

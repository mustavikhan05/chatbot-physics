into dust. For other uses: Ultrasonic sound is used to find out fine cracks in metal blocks or metal sheets, to clean tiny electronic machines and also to destroy the harmful germs. The uses of infrasonic sound: The range of infrasonic sound is from 1 Hz to 20 Hz. Men cannot hear this sound but some animals can hear it. Elephants communicate with each other using infrasonic sound. This sound can travel a long distance without any Figure: 7.15 Physics 123 change. This type of sound is produced during earth quakes and nuclear explosions and destroys many things with great shake. Mathematical example 7.3 A man clapped standing on one of the banks of a river. Echo is heard after 1.5s due to the reflection of the sound from another bank. If the velocity of sound at that time is 340ms-1, what is the breadth of the river? Solution: Suppose the breadth of river d. We know, 2d= v.t  So,

placed on the different parts of the body detect the electrical impulses coming from different directions within the heart. To get a complete picture of the heart, twelve signals are identified using ten electrodes. An electrode lead is placed on each arm and leg i.e. total of four and rest six electrodes are placed across the chest wall [Figure 14.6]. The signals received from each electrode are recorded. The printed view of these recordings is the electro gram. Physics 235 Figure 14.6: ECG procedure For a healthy person, there are normal patterns of the electrical impulses from each electrode. If any type of abnormal condition is observed in the heart of a person, then the patterns from the electrodes will be different from that of a normal pattern. Generally, ECG test is done to find the cause of external symptoms such as- palpitations, irregular and fast heart beat, chest pain etc. of some diseases. Sometimes it is done as a part of routine tests- for example, before you have an operation you can take the help of ECG. The heart disorders that can be detected by ECG are: 1. Abnormal heart rhythms- for example, if the heart is very fast, very slow or irregular. 2. A heart attack- which happened recent or some time ago. 3. An enlarged heart- i.e. the size of the heart is increased. Endoscopy Generally endoscopy means looking inside something. But by endoscopy we mean looking interior of a hollow organ or cavity of the body for medical reasons using an endoscope machine. We examine the interior side of hollow organs of our body using endoscope machine.  Figure: 14.7 Endoscopy In an endoscope machine, there are two tubes. Through one of them light is transferred to a definite organ of patientâ€™s body from outside. Due to the total internal reflection of light on the inner wall of the optical fiber, bright light enters the body cavity of patient. 236

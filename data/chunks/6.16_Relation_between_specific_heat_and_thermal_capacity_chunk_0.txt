We know, the amount of heat required to increase the temperature of a body through 1K is called its heat capacity. Again if the specific heat of the material of a body is S, then S joule heat is required to raise the temperature of the body through 1K. Therefore, to increase the  temperature through 1K of a body with a mass of 1kg the amount of heat required = S joule ∴ to increase the  temperature through 1K of a body with a mass of m kg the amount of heat required = mS joule It is the heat capacity of the body with a mass of m kg. ∴Heat capacity, C = mS joule … … … (6.8) or, Heat capacity = mass × specific heat ∴ Specific heat = It is the relation between heat capacity and specific heat.

Hour B. Creative Question 1. Sheuli, a student of class10 cannot see the written words on the blackboard. She consults with the doctor and the doctor advised her to use a lens of power -2D as spectacle. a) What is lens? b) How do you identify lens without touching it? c) What is the focal length of Sheuli’s spectacle? d) Explain why it is logical for Sheuli to use a spectacle of (-)ve power. 160 Physics Chapter ten STATICAL ELECTRICITY [We know that every matter consists of protons and electrons. Do you know that there are more than 1028 protons and almost equal number of electrons in your body? The basic property of these protons and electrons is charge. The charge of proton is considered as positive and of electron is negative. The charged objects that apply force on each other is known as electric force. The electric force is a basic and important force of nature. In this chapter we will see how a body is charged. We will also learn detect the presence of charge and measure the force between them. As the discussed charges will remain static we will call the chapter Statical Electricity. Finally we will discuss the usage of this static charge and some of its danger and the ways to remain safe from them.] By the end of this chapter we will be able to- 1. Explain the basic causes of production of charge on the basis of structure of atom. 2. Explain the causes of production of charges by the process induction and friction. 3. Detect the nature of charge by electroscope. 4. Measure the electric force applying Coulomb’s law. 5. Explain the cause of production of electric field. 6. Explain the direction of electric lines of force can represent the direction of electric field. 7. Explain the electric potential. 8. Explain the function of capacitor to preserve electric energy. 9. Explain the usage of static electricity. 10. Explain the strategy to be safe from the risk of danger of static electricity. Physics  161

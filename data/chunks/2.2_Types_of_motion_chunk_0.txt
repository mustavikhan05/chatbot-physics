Linear motion : If a body is in motion along a straight line, that is, if the motion of a body is restricted on a straight line its motion is called linear motion. The motion of a car in a straight street is linear motion. Rotational motion : When a body rotates around a particular point or an axis keeping the distance of the particles of the body unchanged is called rotational motion. For Rectilinear motion : When a body moves along a straight line in such a way that each particle of the body travels the same distance at the same time in the same direction. If a book is pushed to shift from one end to the other of a table without rotation, the motion will be rectilinear because all the particles of the book travel the equal distance, at equal time in the same direction. Periodic motion : If the motion of a moving particle is such that it passes through a definite point along the path of its motion in the same direction in a definite interval of time, this type of motion is called periodic motion. This motion can be circular, elliptical or rectilinear. The motion of the hands of a clock, the motion of earth round the sun, the motion of piston in the cylinder of a steam or petrol engine etc. The time interval at which a particle of periodic motion passes through a definite point from the same direction repeatedly is called its time period. Vibratory motion : If a body executing periodic motion moves in a definite direction for one half of its time period and exactly for the other half in the opposite direction then 30  Physics this motion is called vibratory motion. Motion of a simple pendulum, motion of vibrating tuning fork and the motion of string of guitar.

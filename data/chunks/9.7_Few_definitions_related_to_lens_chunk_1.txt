to the incident ray then it is called optical centre. In figure 9.12 a ray of light PQ incidents on a surface of lens and refracts along the path QR. This ray emerges from the other surface along the path RS. The emergent ray RS and incident ray PQ are parallel to each other. The refracted ray QR intersects the principal axis C1C2 at point O inside the lens. The point O is called the optical centre of the lens. Figure: 9.12 For a thin lens the point on the principal axis through which if the ray of light is passed and due to refraction no deviation of ray takes place that point inside the lens is called optical centre. Principal focus: When a pencil of parallel rays adjacent to the principal axis incident on a lens in a direction parallel to principal axis, then after refraction the refracted rays either actually converge to a point on the principal axis (in the case of convex lens) or they appear to diverge from a point on the principal axis (in the case of concave lens). This point on the principal axis is called the principal focus of the lens. In figure 9.13 the point F is the principal focus of the lens. 150  Physics Focal length: The distance of the principal focus from the optical centre of a lens is called the focal length of the lens. Focal length is expressed by f. In the figure 9.13 OF is the focal length of the lens.  Figure: 9.13 Focal plane: The imaginary plane at the principal focus perpendicular to the principal axis is called focal plane of the lens. In the figure 9.14 ABCD is the focal plane of the lens.

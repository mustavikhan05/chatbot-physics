i.e., ma F ∞ kF = (3.2) Here, k is a constant of proportionality. To define the unit of force Newton consider k=1. The unit of force is Newton (N). One newton (N) is defined as the force that will produce an acceleration of 1ms-2 when it acts on a mass of 1 kg. Thus if mass m is in kg, acceleration a is in ms-2, and force F is in N, then equation (3.2) becomes, 1. ma F = or F ma =   (3.3) or Force = mass×acceleration The dimension of force: [F] = MLT-2 Mathematical Example 3.1: What is the force to be applied to a mass of 50 kg to produce an acceleration of 4 ms-2 ? We know,    Here, F = ma

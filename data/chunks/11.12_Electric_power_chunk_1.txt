Joule (11.12) Electric power The electric appliances which we use in houses or in offices are generally marked with the voltage by which it runs and the electric power in watt. We know the rate of work done or the rate of energy conversion is called power. Therefore, the rate at which energy is converted into other forms in an electric device is its power. Therefore, power = Work done time = energy converted time âˆ´ W P t = (11.13) 190  Physics Substituting the value of W from equation (11.11) we get, P VI =

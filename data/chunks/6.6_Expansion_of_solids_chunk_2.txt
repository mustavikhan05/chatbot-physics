Superficial expansion and coefficient of superficial expansion: The area of a solid is increased with the increase of temperature. It is called superficial expansion. Let initial surface area of a solid at θ1 temperature = A1 When the temperature is increased to θ2 the final surface area = A2 Increase in temperature = θ2 - θ1 And increase in area = A2 – A1 The coefficient of superficial expansion is expressed by the symbol β ∴ Superficial expansion, β = … … … (6.3)  =  In equation 6.3 if the surface area A1 = 1m2 and the increase of temperature (θ2 - θ1) = 1K is considered, then the increase in surface area β = A2-A1=increase in surface area. So, the increase in surface area of 1m2 surface area of a solid for the rise of temperature 1K is called the coefficient of superficial expansion of the material of that solid. Its unit is K-1. The coefficient of superficial expansion of copper is 33.4  10-6 K-1. It means that if the temperature of a copper body is increased through 1K, then the increase in surface area of copper is 33.4  10-6 m2. Initial length, l1 = 100m Final length, l2 = 100.033m Initial temperature, θ1 = 20°C Final temperature, θ2 = 50°C Increase of temperature (θ2 -  θ1) = 30K Increase in length, (l2 – l1) = 0.033m Coefficient of linear expansion, α = ? l2 - l1 l1(θ2 - θ1) 0.033m 100m x 30K A2-A1 A1(θ2-θ1) Increase in surface area Initial area x increase of temperature Fig: 6.6 Fig: 6.5 106

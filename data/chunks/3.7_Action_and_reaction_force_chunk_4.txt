v m v + = + Therefore, the sum of the momentum of the objects A and B remains same before and after the collision. It is the law of conservation of momentum. Mathematical Example 3.3: A force of 2000 N acts on a body of mass 20 kg for a time of 0.1 s. What is the change of momentum of the body? Solution: We know, change of momentum = force × time Here, mv mu Ft − = applied force,  F = 2000 N    =2000 N ×

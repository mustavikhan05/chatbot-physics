on a bulb means that it transforms 60 Joules electrical energy to light and heat energy in one second. 200 megawatt power of an electrical power station means that it supplies 200000000 joules energy in one second. We are using this energy in houses, factories and offices. Mathematical Example 4.4: A person of mass 70 kg can stair up 30 steps of 25 cm height each in 15 s. What is his power? (g = 9.8 ms-2) We know, P= = = = 343 W Ans: 343 W Do it: Count the number of steps of the stairs to reach the roof of your school or house or any other building. Measure the height of the roof in meter. Measure your mass with the help of a weight measuring machine in kilogram. Multiply your mass with 9.8 and then you will find your weight in newton. Then run to the top of the roof. Measure the total time of reaching the roof with the help of a stop watch. Your work done will be, your weight ร total height Your power will be, your total work done รท total time i.e.,  . Perform these activities with your friends and compare your power with them. Who is the most powerful student in your class? Work Time Fs t 686 N x 7.5 m 15 s Here, Mass of the person, m = 70 kg Force = Weight of the person = mg = 70 kg x 9.8 ms-2 = 686 N Displacement, S = 35 x 25 cm   = 750 cm   = 7.5 m Time, t=15s Power, P = ?

Therefore pressure rises with the increase of depth of the liquid and also increase in density causes the rise of pressure. As pressure rises with the increase of depth, the liquid comes out with more speed from a hole at greater depth (shown in the figure 5.6). Mathematical Example 5.3 : A vessel contains kerosene. Find the magnitude of pressure at a point 75cm deep from the surface of kerosene. [Density of kerosene is 800kgm-3] Figur: 5.5 Figur: 5.6 Physics 93 Solution We know, P= hρg or, P = 0.75 m × 800 kgm-3 × 9.8 ms-2 = 5880Pa Ans: 5880Pa Given, Depth of the liquid, h=75cm = 0.75m Density of the liquid, ρ = 800 kgm-3 Acceleration due to gravity, g= 9.8ms-2  Pressure P =?

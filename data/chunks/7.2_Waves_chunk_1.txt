Water wave, sound wave etc. are mechanical waves. To transfer the mechanical wave elastic medium is needed. There is another type of wave that does not need any medium to propagate which are called electromagnetic wave. It is mentionable that we will limit discussion only to the mechanical wave in this chapter. Here the wave means the wave produced in elastic medium. The characteristics of waves are the followings: 1. The wave is produced due to the harmonic motion of the particles but the particles are not displaced permanently. Figure: 7.1 Figure: 7.2 Figure: 7.3 116  Physics 2. A medium is necessary for the propagation of mechanical wave. 3. The wave transfers energy from one place to another. 4. The velocity of wave depends on the nature of medium. 5. The reflection, refraction and superposition occur in case of wave. Classification of wave: There are two kinds of wave: 1. Transverse wave

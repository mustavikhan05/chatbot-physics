[Figure 12.1] Oersted invented the magnetic effect of current. Do yourself.  Make a circuit like the picture aside. Place a compass under the wire as if it faced to North-South. Now let the switch on. What is happening to the needle of compass? We see that the needle is moving to one side after switching on the current on circuit. If we alter the electric connection, the needle of the compass will move the other side. From this effect, we can understand that a magnetic field is produced when a current flows through a wire.

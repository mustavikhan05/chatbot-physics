a sphere acts as the reflector, that is if regular reflection of light takes place from the concave surface of the spherical mirror, then it is called a concave mirror. In this case, concave mirror is made by silvering on the convex surface of the part of the sphere [figure 8.5]. The concave mirror is a 130 Physics converging mirror since the parallel beam of light converges at a point or meets together after reflection from its surface. Figure: 8.5 Figure: 8.6 Convex mirror: If the convex surface of a sphere acts as the reflector, that is if regular reflection of light takes place from the convex surface of the spherical mirror, then it is called a convex mirror. In this case, convex mirror is made by silvering on the concave or inner surface of the part of the sphere [Figure 8.5]. The convex mirror is a diverging mirror since the parallel beam of light diverges from a point or spreads over and never meets at a point after reflection [Figure 8.6]. Some definitions related to spherical mirrors Pole: The central point of the reflecting surface of a spherical mirror is called the pole of the mirror.  In figure 8.7, P is the pole of the mirror. Pole is the lowest point of the reflecting surface in case of a concave mirror, while it is the highest point in a convex mirror. Center of curvature: The centre of the sphere of which the spherical mirror is a part is called the centre of curvature of that mirror. In figure 8.7, C is the centre of curvature. Radius of curvature: The radius of the sphere of which the spherical mirror is a part is called the radius of curvature of that mirror. In figure 8.7, PC or MC is the radius of curvature. Radius of curvature is denoted by r.
